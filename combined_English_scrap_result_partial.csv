JAFAR ALDEBARAN,5.0,"the place is shady, cool, many tall and big trees. the room is pleasant, makes you feel at home inside. if it's cold at night, but there is a heater and there is also air conditioning.  Children are happy because they can play with lights that can change color, windows that can be dimmed with just one push. there is a background sound therapy sound of river flow or forest. In the morning, you can have breakfast with liwet rice or uduk rice and coffee/tea, you just have to choose. it's just that if you're hungry after midnight, you should prepare food, because the stall is quite far away and you have to go down again, and the street is dark and deserted. in the application facility we can order food, but when we order, it turns out that it is not available/not available, or maybe it's lazy. if there really isn't/can't be, it's better to just remove the food ordering menu in the application, so we don't have to hope anymore. finally at that time I had to go out/down to find a food stall.  There is a Tirta Sela waterfall not far from the cabin. the water is so clear. in the middle of the journey there is also a toilet, so if you get confused you can go to the toilet first, not at the waterfall. There is a deck/stage building and chairs for photos.  in the morning/afternoon there are sellers around jasuke, siomay, ornamental plants/bonsai.",8 months,Bobocabin Baturraden Purwokerto,"tempatnya teduh, sejuk, banyak pohon tinggi dan besar. ruangannya menyenangkan, bikin betah di dalam. kalau malam dingin tapi ada heater dan ada ac juga.  anak² senang karena bisa mainan lampu yang bisa berganti² warna, jendela yang bisa diburamkan hanya dengan sekali pencetan. ada backsound suara terapi aliran sungai atau hutan. paginya dapat sarapan nasi liwet atau nasi uduk dan kopi/teh tinggal memilih. cuma kalau laper pas tengah malam harus sedia persediaan makanan, karena warung agak jauh harus turun lagi, dan jalannya gelap dan sepi. di fasilitas aplikasinya kita bisa pesan makanan, tapi pas pesan, nyatanya enggak bisa/enggak tersedia, atau mungkin mas/mbaknya lagi malas. kalau memang enggak ada/enggak bisa, lebih baik dihilangkan saja menu pesanan makanan di aplikasinya, jadi kita enggak terlanjur berharap. akhirnya waktu itu ya terpaksa keluar/turun cari warung makan.  ada air terjun curug tirta sela yang enggak jauh dari cabin. airnya begitu jernih. di tengah perjalanan ada juga toilet, jadi kalau pas kebelet bisa ke toilet dulu, bukan di air terjunnya. ada bangunan deck/panggung dan kursi untuk foto².  kalau pagi/siang suka ada penjual keliling jasuke, siomay, tanaman hias/bonsai."

Rama Randika,1.0,"the accountability is not fast enough, slow‼️ be careful who want to go there by vehicle, because parking in the forest area (bobocabin) if a branch or tree branch falls which causes our car to be damaged is not bobocabin's responsibility. the officer there also admitted that the trees there were old and it was very natural for an incident like this, so at most they were given a breakfast complaint. (not comparable) as a result, I had to replace it with my own money, oh from March to August there has been no clarity from bobocabin⭐️",10 months,Bobocabin Baturraden Purwokerto,"pertanggung jawabannya kurang cepat, lelet‼️ hati-hati yang mau kesana membawa kendaraan, karena parkir di area hutan (bobocabin) jika kejatuhan ranting atau dahan pohon yang menyebabkan mobil kita rusak bukan tanggung jawab bobocabin.  kata petugas disana pun mengakui bahwa pohon2 disana sudah pada tua dan sangat wajar untuk kejadian seperti ini, jadi paling dikasih komplaiment sarapan saja.

There is also a shared kitchen with a Wicrowave so we can remember the food we brought. fyi for breakfast, in front of the lobby there is a seller of yellow rice. for bbq you can also order it if you want, if I brought the equipment and the ingredients myself yesterday.. the reason is that as long as I stay at Bobocabin Baturaden is pleasant, next time I will definitely plan to stay there again..",11 months,Bobocabin Baturraden Purwokerto,"tempat yang cocok sekali buat ng-chill, suasana nya enak banget, view kota purwokerto terlihat bagus, ketika ksna cuaca nya enggak dingin2 banget, enak segar udara nya, cocok untuk menyepi dari hiruk pikuk suasana kota yang crowded..cabin nya nyaman sekali, canggih, toilet nya nyaman cuman karena water heater nya pakai listrik jadi sudah di pakai mandi 1 orang musti menunggu sekitar 2 jam buat air nya panas lagi, tapi mandi pakai air dingin juga segar kok..kasurnya mungkin di desain khusus buat cabin, jadi enggak terlalu empuk kayak di hotel2 pada umunya tapi so far masih tetap nyaman dan bisa tidur nyenyak. terdapat juga dapur bersama yang ada wicrowave nya jadi kita bisa ngangetin makanan yang kita bawa. fyi untuk sarapan pagi, di depan lobby nya suka ada yang jualan nasi kuning. untuk bbq juga bisa di pesan kalo mau, kalo aku kemarin bawa sendiri peralatan sama bahan2 nya..pkknya selama stay di bobocabin baturraden menyenangkan, next pasti di agendakn untuk stay ksna lagi.."
Icha Afkarina,5.0,"First after booking, it is highly recommended to immediately download the bobobox application because we enter and exit the cabin via scanning the application.

The location is approximately 30 minutes from Purwokerto station. The place is good for healing, it is in the middle of the botanical garden. It's very cold. Prepare your jacket 🙂 Bring food. Unfortunately it was raining when we went there so we couldn't have a barbecue, but it's good for sleeping. The hot water works well even though 2 people have to wait to take a shower.

It's not wheelchair and stroller friendly :(",11 months,Bobocabin Baturraden Purwokerto,"pertama setelah booking, sangat disarankan untuk segera download aplikasi bobobox karena kita masuk keluar cabin via scan aplikasi. nanti jam 14.00 check-ini bakalan banyak yang download barengan. sebelum jam 14.00 checkin saja verifikasi data jalanjalan lalu langsung checkin jam 14.00  lokasinya kurang lebih 30 menit dari stasiun purwokerto. tempatnya enak buat healing ada di tengah kebun raya. dingin banget. prepare your jacket 🙂 bawa makanan. sayang pas kesana hujan jadi enggak bisa bbq-an tapi enak buat tidur sih. air panas berfungsi dengan baik walaupun untuk mandi 2 orang harus menunggu.  sayang untuk masuk harus bayar tiket masuk ke kebun raya. harusnya untuk tamu bobocabin tidak perlu bayar lagi :( karena untuk harga bobocabin di weekday saja sudah pricey.  tidak wheelchair dan stroller friendly ya :("

Rama Rendra Prayoga,5.0,the first time trying to stay at bobocabin baturraden turned out to be a pleasant experience. the shady and cool atmosphere of the baturraden area and the soothing sounds of nature are a pleasant combination. for the size of the room is indeed not too spacious but quite comfortable and the facilities are also quite complete. here we can also do trekking to the waterfall which is not far from the cabin location. the path to the waterfall is quite challenging because you have to go down a fairly steep iron staircase.,a year,Bobocabin Baturraden Purwokerto,pertama kali mencoba menginap di bobocabin baturraden ternyata menjadi pengalaman yang menyenangkan. suasana teduh dan dingin kawasan baturraden dan suara alam yang menenangkan menjadi kombinasi yang menyenangkan. untuk ukuran kamar memang tidak terlalu luas tapi cukup nyaman dan fasilitasnya juga cukup lengkap. di sini kita juga bisa melakukan trekking menuju ke air terjun yang tidak jauh dari lokasi cabin. untuk jalur menuju ke air terjun cukup menantang karena harus menuruni tangga besi yang cukup terjal.

tiffany pracdirana,5.0,"the atmosphere is calm, comfortable, makes you feel at home. the room uses all technology. the walls can be unblurred to lie down while looking at the forest view outside. the bathroom is clean, equivalent to a 4-star hotel. feels safe because there is CCTV everywhere and the staff are always walking around. available for BBQ. the drawbacks: because yesterday was a long weekend, there were many visitors plus the rainy season weather accompanied by lightning so the power went out more than 7 times but the generator automatically turned on. if you go there, you must bring lots of supplies and drinks because it's hard to find food. the cleanliness of the room should be improved, maybe because it is rarely occupied especially in the forest so there are lots of ures ures in the corners. just a suggestion, put some freshener in the room too. it's really worth staying at bobocabin baturaden. also try bobocabin in other cities to see the natural scenery while relaxing quietly away from the hustle and bustle of the city.",a year,Bobocabin Baturraden Purwokerto,"suasananya tenang, nyaman, bikin betah. kamarnya menggunakan teknologi semua. dinding bisa di unblur buat tiduran sambil lihat pemandangan hutan di luar. kamar mandi bersih, setara hotel bintang 4. terasa aman karena cctv dimana mana dan staff yang selalu keliling. tersedia untuk bbq.  kekurangannya: karena kemarin longweekend, banyak pengunjung ditambah cuaca musim hujan disertai petir jadi mati listrik lebih dari 7 kali tetapi genset auto menyala. kalo kesana wajib bawa perbekalan yang buanyak dan minum pastinya karena susah cari makanannya. kebersihan kamar mohon ditingkatkan, mungkin karena jarang ditempati apalagi di hutan jadi banyak ures ures dipojokan. saran saja kasih pengharum juga di kamar.  worth it banget nginep di bobocabin baturaden. mencoba juga bobocabin di kota lain buat lihat pemandangan alam sambil nyantai tenang bebas dari hiruk pikuk perkotaan."

It's just that there are some dirty parts, yes it's called in the forest and maybe because it's rarely occupied too. but the hotel can definitely keep it clean.  Advice for those who want to go there, bring lots of your own supplies, especially drinking water, because there is no one selling food or drink there. Yesterday the chat feature couldn't be used. there are bbq and steamboat packages, complete equipment. there is a public kitchen, but it is very dirty.  Coincidentally, yesterday the rainy season came, there was lots of lightning, plus there were lots of visitors, so the voltage wasn't enough, in the end the electricity went out more than 7 times in the afternoon and evening.",a year,Bobocabin Baturraden Purwokerto,"tempatnya sejuk, tenang, semua menggunakan sistem mulai buka pintu sampai lampu. dari kamar bisa melihat luar jika dinding di setting tidak blur. menyenangkan menginap disana. hanya saja ada beberapa bagian yang kotor, ya namanya di hutan dan mungkin karena jarang ditempati juga. tetapi pihak hotel pasti bisa menjaga kebersihannya.  saran untuk yang mau kesana, bawa perbekalan sendiri yang banyak terutama air minum karena disana tidak ada yang jual makan maupun minum. fitur chat nya kemarin tidak bisa digunakan. ada paketan bbq dan steamboat, alatnya lengkap. ada dapur umum, tapi kotor banget.  kebetulan kemarin datang musim hujan banyak petir ditambah lagi banyak pengunjung jadi voltase tidak cukup, akhirnya mati listrik dari sore-malam ada lebih dari 7kali."

Dinda Rizki Bestary,5.0,"The first experience of staying at bobocabin, and precisely bobocabin baturaden, was very memorable. My husband and I deliberately invited my mother and father-in-law, just to heal at a lodging other than a hotel, and thank God they were very happy. In terms of location, it is indeed very high, but still reachable by any vehicle, but before entering the bobocabin area we must first enter the baturaden tourist attraction and there is an entrance fee of 25k per person and 10k for cars, so the total I paid was 110k (not bad, right, mom) lol, in this bobocabin, the cabins are terraced so you have to climb the stairs according to the cabin number we get, the further away the more stairs, so I suggest that if you bring parents or the elderly, you can request a room that is not far from the lobby. for food, you can bring it from outside, and there is also a public kitchen so you can warm up food etc., you can also order food by ojol like me yesterday, there is no TV there so we can really relax enjoying nature and chat a lot about this and that with family. Masyaallah it's really different from the others. It's worth a try! Oh yeah, there's also a waterfall below the cabin area, but I suggest that if you go there, you have to be really capable of going up and down the stairs because the path is quite steep, and for parents, I also suggest that it's better not to try it because the stairs are really down and steep, but once you get there, the tiredness will be paid off with the river water which is Masyaallah really clear and really really fresh! That's my assessment, which is just a short explanation but also long, lol.",a year,Bobocabin Baturraden Purwokerto,"pengalaman pertama menginap di bobocabin, dan tepatnya bobocabin baturaden, berkesan sekali. saya dan suami sengaja ajak ibu dan bapak mertua saya, sekedar healing2 di penginapan selain hotel, dan alhamdulillah banget mereka senang.  dari segi lokasi memang diatas banget ya, tapi masih terjangkau oleh kendaraan apapun, tapi sebelum masuk ke daerah bobocabin kita harus masuk dulu ke lokawisata baturadennta dan ada biaya masuk per kepala 25k dan mobil 10k, jadi total saya bayar itu 110k (lumayan ya bunda) wkwkwk, di bobocabin ini kan cabin2nya itu berundak2 jadi harus naik tangga sesuai nomor cabin yang kita dapat, semakin jauh semakin banyak tangga, jadi saya menyarankan kalo bawa orang tua atau lansia bisa request kamar yang enggak jauh dari lobby ya.  untuk makanan bisa dibawa dari luar, dan disana juga disediakan dapur umum jadi bisa untuk anget2in makanan dll, bisa juga pesan makanan by ojol seperti saya kemarin, disana enggak ada tv ya jadi kita benar-benar relaksasi menikmati alam dan banyak mengobrol cerita ini itu dengan keluarga.  masyaallah banget beda dari yang lain deh. patut dicoba! oya disini ada juga curug dibawah area cabin, tapi saya menyarankan kalo kesana yang benar-benar sanggup turun naik tangga karena jalur nya cukup curam, dan untuk orang tua saya menyarankan juga lebih baik jangan mencoba karena benar-benar turun dan curam tangga nya, tapi kalo sudah sampai sana ya terbayar ya lelahnya dengan air sungai nya yang masyaallah bening banget dan segar banget banget banget!  sekian penilaian dari saya yang hanya singkap tapi panjang juga wkwk."

cabin number is given by the system so you can't choose - to check this you need to download the bobobox apps - it is recommended that you bring your own trash bag to be thrown in the trash. please don't leave trash in a place as beautiful as this. - there are not many employees here and to serve an area this large it takes patience, you can be more independent if there are missing amenities or other things, you can chat first then pick it up in the lobby. - this place is safe from dangerous animals (crawlers, etc.) that we encountered were squirrels, monkeys - the best time to enjoy it is when the fog descends in the afternoon and dawn - if you are interested in coming here, please switch your mode into relax mode so that you can enjoy nature here more - staying more than 1 night is highly recommended - bring mosquito repellent lotion, yes The advantages - quiet, far from the hustle and bustle, very beautiful - futuristic hi-tech cabin design (no TV) - clean - bed size 160-180, 2 pillows, 1 blanket - complete toiletries if you don't have enough towels / mops, you can request - fast and good wifi - for food you can order from partner cabin restaurants via the bobobox app, almost everything tastes good, the price is still reasonable, you have to be patient because you have to wait 1 hour. so if you want to eat at 6 pm, order your meal 1 hour before - another option is to order via gak*ab / gak*food - friendly and helpful staff - shortcomings - no access for disabled people - some of the access lights in the cabin area are out, input for bobocabin - maybe there could be a partner to provide transportation to and from the location at a certain cost - if there is a shuttle to other tourist locations it could be easier - bicycle / electric motorbike / other rentals are provided so that you can explore the surrounding area - need to add a signal booster so that when the wifi is off you can still use the provider's signal - need to be given an appeal for guests to be responsible for their trash and cigarette butts, many found cigarette butts, bottle caps, instant drink plastic scattered in the cabin area - trash cans outside the cabin - to be more educational maybe the trees could be given name tags and explanations - for us who come from big cities, the location and vibes are 5 * highly recommended to stay here. hopefully with the presence of bobocabin the environment remains beautiful without disturbing the ecosystem",a year,Bobocabin Baturraden Purwokerto,"ubelieveble place to stay  bobocabin baturaden tempat ini baru saja buka sekitar 3-4 bulan lalu, kami book melalui ag*di* untuk tipe kamar deluxe cabin untuk 3 hari 2 malam -

disarankan kalian bisa bawa plastik sampah sendiri untuk bisa dibuang ke tempat  sampah. please banget jangan tinggalkan sampah ditempah seindah ini. - pegawai disini enggak banyak dan untuk melayani area seluas ini perlu kesabaran, kalian bisa lebih mandiri kalau ada ammenities kurang atau hal yang lain, bisa chat dulu kemudian ambil di lobby. - tempat ini sudah aman dari hewan2 yang berbahaya (melata, dsb) yang kami jumpai tupai monyet - waktu terbaik untuk dinikmati saat kabutnya turun sore dan subuh - kalau minat kesini pls switch your mode into relax mode spaya lebih bisa menikmati alam disini - stay lebih dari 1 malam sangat disarankan - bawa lotion anti nyamuk ya  kelebihan - sepi jauh dari hiruk pikuk asri banget - desain cabin futuristik hi tech (no tv) - bersih - size bed 160-180 an 2 bantal 1 selimut - toileteries lengkap kalo kurang handuk / mop bisa req - wifi cepat dan bagus - untuk makan bisa dari rsto rekanan cabin order via apps bobobox hampir semua rasanya enak harganya masih wajar mesti sabar ya karena nunggunya 1 jam. jadi kalo mau makan jam 18an ya order makan 1 jam sebelumnya - opsi lain order bisa via enggak*ab / enggak*food - pegawai ramah dan helpfull -  kekurangan - tidak tersedia akses untuk disabilitas - beberapa lampu akses jalan di area cabin banyak yang mati  masukan untuk bobocabin - mungkin bisa ada rekanan agar bisa menyediakan transportasi dari dan ke lokasi dengan biaya tertentu - apabila ada shuttle untuk ke lokasi wisata lainnya bisa memudahkan - disediakan persewaan sepeda / motor listrik / yang lain agar bisa explore area sekitar - perlu di tambah penguat sinyal agar saat wifi mati masih bisa menggunakan sinyal provider - perlu diberi himbauan agar tamu bertanggung jawab thd sampah dan putung rokoknya, banyak menemukan putungbrokok, tutup botol, plastik minuman instan berserakan di area cabin - tempat sampah di luar cabin - agar lebih edukatif mungkin pohonnya bisa dikasih tag nama dan penjelasannya apa -  buat kami yang berasal dari kota besar lokasinya dan vibesnya 5* sangat direkomendasikan untuk stay disini.  semoga dengan adanya bobocabin lingkungan tetap asri tidak mengganggu ekosistem"

Dion WaldrofIndonesia,4.0,"The service was good from the parking team who were quick in their actions and also helped me, who sometimes parked less neatly🙏. the rooms are clean, the breakfast is also delicious and simple, it's just that the dinner menu is western in my opinion. because we don't consume red meat, I think there is a village fried rice menu😅. that's all my input. Oh yeah, the internet is freaking awesome.  I deliberately stayed here and left early so there wasn't too much traffic jam because it was a holiday. So you can go straight to Orchid first, it's still quite quiet and you can wait at the coffee shop and the parking is a bit free. 11am and above don't expect it to be quiet🤣 . cool place to read a book, do yoga in front of the cabin, or jog around the cabin, oh what a fun track for my feet❤️ I'm satisfied with my holiday at Bobocabin Cikole, oh yes, I hope visitors and managers both keep the surrounding environment clean so that nature is protected, trees and land🌻🌾❤️ Don't be fooled by the fact that paying visitors like to throw rubbish carelessly 💔 let's cultivate order and discipline 🌻",3 weeks,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"pelayanannya baik dari team parkir yang sigap tindakannya juga membantu saya yang kadang parkirnya kurang rapi🙏. kamar bersih, sarapan juga enak simpel, hanya saja menu santap makan malamnya western menurut saya. karena kami tidak konsumsi daging merah, saya pikir ada menu nasi goreng kampung😅. itu saja sih masukan dari saya. oh iya internet kuenceng aduhai.  sengaja inap kesini berangkat pagi biar tak terlalu macet karena hari libur. jadi bisa langsung ke orchid dulu masih cukup sepi dan bisa menunggu di warung kopi dan parkir rada lenggang. jam 11an keatas jangan harap sepi🤣 . tempat asik buat baca buku, yoga didepan cabin, atau jogging keliling sekitar cabin aduh treknya seru untuk kakiku❤️  puas liburan di bobocabin cikole ini ohiya saya harap pengunjung dan pengelola sama-sama menjaga kebersihan lingkungan sekitar ya agar alam terjaga pepepohonan juga tanah🌻🌾❤️ jangan mentang-mentang pengunjung bayar suka seenaknya buang sampah sembarangan💔 mari budayakan tertib dan disiplin 🌻"
Dessy Eka Purnama,3.0,"the natural scenery is quite nice and some cabins are also neatly arranged and aesthetic. the touch of technology in the cabin adds to the comfortable atmosphere of staying in the cabin. unfortunately, the shuttle transportation is still very limited so that the waiting time for customers to the cabin takes quite a long time. please increase it again. the breakfast is also a bit less fresh and less varied, maybe you can try adding another menu. I do not recommend staying here during the holiday season because the price is really overpriced.. 👀",3 weeks,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"pemandangan alamnya cukup bagus dan beberapa cabin juga tersusun dengan rapi serta estetik. sentuhan teknologi di cabin menambah suasana nyaman stay di cabin. sayangnya, transport shuttlenya masih sangat amat terbatas sehingga waktu tunggu customer ke cabin memakan waktu yang cukup lama. tolong diperbanyak lagi ya. makanan paginya juga agak kurang fresh dan kurang variatif, mungkin bisa dicoba tambahkan menu lain. saya tidak menyarankan untuk stay disini saat holiday season karena harganya menjadi overpriceeeee banget.. 👀"

Farida Fathoniah,5.0,"second time staying at bobocabin bandung; first in ranca upas, second in cikole. personally i prefer cikole. it feels more natural and cool. the road to the location is safe and there are not many obstacles for cars. the parking lot is also spacious. there is a kind of ""shuttle"" car that looks like a trail, which can accommodate visitors from the parking lot to the lobby. i stayed in a deluxe cabin for 2 people. it is comfortable because the bathroom is inside and is big enough for 1 person to pray. surprisingly my cabin was not damp at all; the sleeping area and bathroom were clean. for the cabin without a bathroom, it is located higher up near the front office, not far from the bathroom. the staff is very helpful, starting from the security in the parking lot to the one in the cabin area. i ordered a bonfire around 9 and was helped to light the fire. for breakfast, the location is in the lobby/front office starting at 7. the place is open space with a limited number of tables + chairs. my suggestion is to wake up a bit early so you can get a comfortable table and chairs and not have difficulty eating without a table. standard breakfast menu of fried rice, fried noodles, side dishes such as soy sauce chicken, sunny side up egg, fruits, infused water and juice. I think all the food is quite delicious; it feels like the ""intention"" of cooking and seasoning, not bland at all.",a month,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"kali kedua nginep di bobocabin bandung; pertama di ranca upas, kedua di cikole. saya pribadi lebih suka yang cikole. lebih terasa asri dan sejuk.  jalan menuju lokasi termasuk aman dan enggak banyak obstacle buat mobil. parkirannya pun luas. ada semacam mobil ""shuttle"" yang bentuknya mirip trail, yang bisa accommodate pengunjung dari parkiran ke lobby.  saya menginap di cabin deluxe untuk 2 orang. termasuk yang nyaman karena kamar mandinya di dalam dan luasnya cukup untuk solat 1 orang. surprisingly cabin saya tidak lembab sama sekali; area tidur dan kamar mandi pun bersih.  untuk cabin yang tanpa kamar mandi, letaknya lebih ke atas mendekati front office, tidak jauh dengan kamar mandi.  staff nya sangat helpful, mulai dari security di parkiran sampai yang di area cabin. saya memesan bonfire sekitar jam 9 dan dibantu menyalakan apinya.  untuk sarapan, lokasinya di lobby/front office mulai jam 7. tempatnya open space dengan jumlah meja+kursi yang terbatas. saran saya bangun agak pagi supaya bisa dapat meja dan kursi yang nyaman dan tidak kesulitan makan tanpa meja. menu sarapan standar nasi goreng, mie goreng, lauk pauk seperti ayam kecap, sunny side up egg, buah, infused water dan jus. menurut saya semua makanannya cukup enak; terasa ""niat"" masak dan memberi bumbu, tidak hambar sama sekali."
Mutiara Ayu F,3.0,"the location and view are great. the service staff are also agile. but unfortunately the cabin and jacuzzi itself look low maintenance. not worth it for the fairly high price. there are many insects in the jacuzzi area and the cabin. there is also poor air circulation in the cabin. the jacuzzi water is not clean and the area is not closed, other visitors can see towards the jacuzzi, making it uncomfortable if you want to soak.",a month,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"lokasi dan pemandangannya bagus. service staffnya juga cekatan. namun sayang cabin dan jacoozi nya sendiri terlihat low maintenance. tidak worth it untuk harga yang terbilang lumayan. banyak serangga di area jacoozi sama cabinnya. kurang sirkulasi udara juga di dalam cabin. air jacoozinya kurang bersih dan areanya tidak tertutup, pengunjung yang lain dapat melihat ke arah jacoozi, bikin tidak nyaman jika ingin berendam."

puspita indah,5.0,"really happy to be here, for employee gathering, at the end of 2023 oh yes because the location is in the green grass area of ​​cikole jaya giri, in the middle of a pine forest, and from the entrance to the green grass area to the cabin location is quite good (not too far), with a fairly uphill road, and there are several stairs it seems more proper to use a backpack than a suitcase. got a deluxe cabin type (without jacuzzi), the facilities themselves, the cabin is very clean, there are also 2 bottled mineral waters, and also 2 mugs (without teaspoons/stirring) a sitting toilet, a sink and a hot and cold shower. amenities & towels. bluetooth speaker facilities, mood lamps that can be changed in color, smart windows and doors that are safe because access is with a qr code. very comfortable for a cabin type lodging in the middle of a pine forest. oh yes there are chairs for casual chatting in front of the cabin. overall satisfied with the service, the response with the front office via chat is very fast, asking for additional blankets is immediately delivered and free. wow.. I had experienced the water going out, complaints via chat were immediately responded to and the water came back on in no time. 👍 oh yeah for the hot water shower, the capacity is limited if I'm not mistaken, only 15 liters for the cabin I occupied, so make sure it's enough because if it runs out, it will take a long time to wait for the water to heat up again and make sure to read every detail of the information listed in the cabin. because this is a gathering event, there are dinner and breakfast facilities too. the food is really delicious.. I really like the lotek, the uduk rice is the best. 🤤🤤 oh yeah for those who are stayingcation, there is a small minimarket that is ready to meet your snack and instant food needs. there is also road access to the mountain coffee for those who want to have beautiful coffee, so you don't have to go around far. overall very satisfied, and it's really fun to stay here.. those who think because it's in the middle of a pine forest might be scary, gaiss not at all. very pleasant.. as input for the housekeeping section, maybe it can be added during peak season like this, because I was only able to check in at 14.30🫠",4 months,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"senang banget bisa kesini, dalam rangka employee gathering, di akhir tahun 2023  oiyaa karena lokasinya di green grass area cikole jaya giri, ditengah² hutan pinus, dan dari pintu masuk green grass area ke lokasi cabin cukup lumayan (enggak jauh² amat juga), dengan jalan yang lmyn menanjak, dan ada beberapa anak tangga kayaknya lebih proper menggunakan ransel daripada koper.  dapat cabin type deluxe (tanpa jacuzzi), fasilitasnya sendiri, cabinnya bersih banget tersedia juga 2 air mineral kemasan, dan juga 2 mug (tanpa sendok teh/pengaduk) closet duduk, wastafel dan shower air panas dan dingin. amenities & handuk. fasilitas bluetooth speaker, moodlamp yang bisa diubah² warnanya, smart window dan pintu yang aman karena aksesnya dengan qr code. nyaman banget untuk sebuah penginapan tipe cabin di tengah hutan pinus. oiyaa tersedia kursi untuk mengobrol santai di depan cabin.  overall puas sama pelayanannya, respon dengan bag. front office via chat cepat banget, meminta tambahan selimut langsung diantar dan free. wow.. sempat ngalamin airnya mati, complain melalui chat langsung direspon dan enggak lama air nyala kembali.👍  oiya untuk shower air panasnya, kapasitasnya terbatas kalo enggak salah hanya 15 liter untuk cabin yang saya tempati jadi pastikan cukup karena kalau habis lama lagi menunggu airnya bisa panas kembali dan pastikan untuk membaca setiap detail informasi yang tertera di dalam cabin.  karena ini acara gathering, ada fasilitas makan malam dan sarapan pagi juga. enak banget makanannyaa.. loteknya suka banget, nasi uduknya ah the best.🤤🤤 oiya untuk yang staycation, tersedia minimarket kecil yang siap memenuhi kebutuhan cemilan dan makanan instan kalian. ada juga akses jalan menuju kopi gunung buat yang mau ngopi² cantik, biar enggak muter jauh².  overall puas banget, dan menyenangkan sekali nginep disini.. yang punya pikiran karena ditengah hutan pinus mungkin seram, gaiss sama sekali enggk. menyenangkan sekali..  sebagai masukan untuk bagian housekeepingnya mungkin bisa ditambahkan ketika sedang peak season seperti ini, karena saya baru bisa check-ini di jam 14.30🫠"

Rilanti Kamelia,2.0,"good location, cabin facility is quite complete, it's just a shame that it's quite hot during the day because there is no fan. during my stay unfortunately the service was not responsive enough, I stayed on December 23-25, 2023. during peak season it seems the management is not ready, the meal package we bought took a long time to arrive and was not complete according to what was paid so it took a long time to confirm things that should not have been necessary, the hot water in the bath tub outside on the 2nd day in the afternoon until the 3rd day was dead this is very unfortunate, and at night the water in the inn was completely dead for about 1.5 hours. maybe it could be a lesson for better management in the future or later there will be no repeat customers :).",6 months,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"lokasi yang bagus, cabin facility cukup lengkap, hanya sayang kalau siang cukup panas karena tidak ada fan. selama menginap sayangnya pelayanan tidak cukup tanggap, saya menginap di tanggal 23-25 desember 2023. ketika peak season sepertinya managementnya belum siap, paket makan yang kami beli sangat lama datangnya dan tidak lengkap sesuai yang dibayarkan sehingga ini banyak memakan waktu lama untuk konfirmasi hal yang seharusnya tidak perlu, air panas bath tub di luar hari ke 2 sore hingga hari ke 3 mati ini sangat amat disayangkan, dan ketika malam air di penginapan mati totl selama kurang lebih 1,5 jam.  mungkin bisa jadi pelajaran managemen kedepannya lebih baik atau nantinya tidak akan ada repeat customer :)."

Felix Felicis,2.0,"came to bobocabin because of recommendations from friends for holiday gateway. at first i was curious because the concept of this cabin is the wood with smart system. good point for smart systems (smart lighting and smart window) from architect point of view, there are some things lacking: (note: i came to check this at night and it was raining heavily. i ordered deluxe) 1. uphill rocky road and lack of street lighting (when it rains at night, it's very scary) 2. when it rains, you have to take out your phone, not good. your phone can get wet. canopy on the entrance door is not helpful after all 3. so much weakness on the interior design. when you build this cabin the wood (pay attention to the weather and condition) with hpl, it easily gets burst open and bubbles. the hpl grout is not neat, maybe the grout distance is too big. this is really a shame 4. the lighting itself is not that bright altho it's already 100% bright. 5. bathroom using ceramic? all the ceramics are coming off lol. the ceramic grout is not cleaned properly, that's why there's moss everywhere. why don't use solid surface for the showerpan? so it's seamless. and the floor drain. it stucks, so flood this showerpan. 6. using pvc for bathroom floor for dry bathroom? i don't know its a good choice 7. sink too big? using other furniture to place our bathroom amenities. using hpl for this furniture bathroom. hpl is not waterproof, ngelotok everything 8. hand shower placement is too low 9. no activities provided complimentary whatsoever. everything is must be paid 10. exterior wise: the gutters are filled with pine branches lol. rainwater does not flow properly 11. canopy at entrance door is not properly built. even though I already use glass. it's just a shame :( 12. shoes place at outside? 13. pest is not good. too many flies, mosquitos, other small bugs (some kind of child flies). other notes: pay something 200 rupiah just for sleep and take a shower with a view of the pine forest is too pricey. maybe consider taking care more of the details what customers need. other hold on to that, this experience is for one's lifetime. thank you for the new experience of this ini indonesia. keep on good work bobobox!",7 months,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"dtng ke bobocabin karena rekomen dari teman-teman untuk holiday gateway. awalnya saya penasaran karena konsep cabin ini the wood with smart system. good point for smart systems (smart lighting and smart window) from architect point of view, ada beberapa hal yang kurang: (note: saya dtng check ini malam hari dan hujan deras. saya pesan deluxe) 1. jalanan bebatuan yang menanjak dan lampu penerangan jalan yang kurang (waktu hujan malam2, sangat seram) 2. ketika hujan, harus mengeluarkan hp, not good. hp bisa basah. canopy di entrance door not helpful after all 3. so much weakness on the interior design. when lu build cabin ini the wood (pay attention to the weather and condition) with hpl, it easily gets burst open dan gelembung. nat hpl enggak rapi, maybe jarak nat nya too big. sayang banget ini 4. lighting itself not that bright altho sudah 100% brigtness nya. 5. bathroom using ceramic? semua keramiknya copot lol. nat keramik enggak dibersihkan dengan benar, makanya lumut everywhere. why dont use solid surface untuk showerpan nya? supaya seamless. and the floor drain. it stucks, so flood ini showerpan. 6. using pvc for bathroom floor for kamar mandi kering? i dont know its a good choice 7. sink too big? using other furniture to place our bathroom amenities. using hpl for furniture ini bathroom. hpl is not waterproof, ngelotok semua 8. peletakan hand shower is too low 9. no activities provided complimentarity whatsoever. everything is must be paid 10. exterior wise: talang air isinya dahan2 pinus lol. air hujan tidak mengalir seharusnya 11. canopy at entrance door is not properly built. padahal sudah pakai kaca. sayang saja begitu :( 12. shoes place at outside? 13. pest is not good. too much flies, mosquitos, other small bugs (some kind of anak lalat).  other notes: pay something2 hundred rupiah just for sleep and take a shower with pemandangan hutan pinus is too pricey. maybe consider to take care more of the details what costumers need. other tahan that, this experience is for one ini lifetime. thank you for new experince of this ini indonesia. keep on good work bobobox!"

Melody,3.0,"Overall the cabin is comfortable, clean, and the view is beautiful. The staff at the location are friendly and willing to help lift our suitcases to the cabin. However, there is no air conditioning in the cabin so it is hot during the day. The cabin rental price also does not include breakfast. At that price I think it is overpriced. We tried hiking for 3 people, booked at 7 but the guide was 2 hours late. Previously we had also asked if the cost was really Rp. 75.00/pax and what if there were less than 10 people. The admin then answered ""for hiking if there are less than 10, the cost is still the same ^^"". However, in the end we were charged for 10 people even though there were only three of us and this was not informed in detail. Hopefully it can be fixed in the future so that there is no more miscommunication.",8 months,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"secara keseluruhan kabinnya nyaman, bersih, dan pemandangannya indah. staf di lokasi ramah dan mau membantu mengangkat koper kami hingga ke kabin. namun, di kabin tidak ada ac sehingga saat siang hari panas. harga sewa kabin juga tidak termasuk makan pagi. dengan harga segitu menurut saya overprice. kami coba kegiatan hiking untuk 3 orang, booked di jam 7 tapi guide-nya terlambat 2 jam. sebelumnya kami juga sudah tanya apakah biayanya benar rp. 75.0/pax dan jika kurang dari 10 orang bagaimana. admin lalu menjawab “untuk hiking jika kurang dari 10 kakaknya tetap biaya yang sama^^”. namun, ujung2nya kami ditagih bayar biaya 10 orang padahal kami cuma bertiga dan hal ini tidak diinfokan secara detail. semoga bisa diperbaiki kedepannya agar tidak lagi terjadi miskomunikasi."

Kiki Kuswanto,4.0,"This time, after being tired from culinary, I wanted to go straight to bed. So we tried staying overnight in a new atmosphere, namely at Bobocabin Cikole Bandung. This is very close to the Orchid Forest. Because the location of Bobocabin is in the Perhutani area, to enter here you have to pay an entrance ticket of 15 thousand per person and 10 thousand for vehicles. Then for the cabin, we happened to choose the deluxe type so there is a bathroom inside, no need to queue with other visitors. The mattress is comfortable, clean, there is hot water. Also equipped with audio technology and room lighting, there are also large windows that use smart glass stickers so you can adjust it to be clear or blurry, the view is also nice and cool here because it is surrounded by pine trees. If you come here, don't forget to bring your own food, okay? so you don't have to bother.",8 months,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"kali ini habis capek kulineran, mau langsung tidur.. jadilah kita mencoba menginap dengan suasana baru yaitu di bobocabin cikole bandung. ini dekat banget dengan orchid forest. karena lokasi bobocabin berada di kawasan perhutani, masuk disini harus bayar tiket masuk sebesar 15 ribu per orang dan 10 ribu untuk kendaraan. lalu untuk cabinnya kebetulan kita pilih yang tipe deluxe jadi ada kamar mandi di dalam, enggak perlu antri dengan pengunjung lainnya. kasur nya nyaman, bersih, ada air panas. dilengkapi juga teknologi audio dan lighting room, ada jendela besar juga yang menggunakan stiker smart glass jadi bisa diatur mau jernih atau dibuat blur pemandangannya juga bagus dan sejuk sekali disini karena dikelilingi pohon pinus. kalau ke sini jangan lopa bawa makanan sendiri ya.. supaya enggak repot."

Liese Huang,3.0,"room: good, especially the executive cabin. but unfortunately there are only 4 so it's hard to get. if possible, deluxe should be revised to executive. because on average people bring children. deluxe should not have too many rooms. increase the executive. service: because the room key uses a barcode and we have to download the application. so everything depends on the network. when the network error occurs, wow, checking this by 1 person takes sooooo long. please find another solution, if the network error occurs. location: unfortunately bobocabin is next to Grafika Cikole. there they like to hold events, and use the mic sound until it's booming. the volume is really loud. in the morning it can be heard, at night it's even worse until 11 pm it can still be heard. want to enjoy the quiet forest atmosphere but can't because of Grafika Cikole who is not self-aware. 2 nights stay, 2 nights also feel the noise. because of Grafika Cikole, I will not stay at bobocabin again. bobocabin must discuss it with Grafika Cikole. their guests should not let their event be heard until bobocabin. why does it have to be so loud. it is enough for their group to hear it, why does it have to be so loud that everyone hears their event. 2 days of staying overnight makes me even more stressed and can't sleep",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"room : bagus ya terutama cabin executive. tapi sayang jumlahnya hanya ada 4 jadi sulit untuk dapat. kalo bisa deluxe direvone jadi executive. karena rata-rata orang bawa anak ya. deluxe jangan kebanyakan kamarnya. membanyaki di executive.  service: karena kunci kamar pakai barcode dan kita harus download appliaksi. jadi semua bergantung pada jaringan. begitu error jaringan, wah check ini 1 orang saja lamaaaa sekali. tolong dicarikan solusi yang lain, kalo sampai jaringan error.  location: sayangnya bobocabin bersebelahan dengan grafika cikole. disitu mereka suka bikin acara, dan pakai suara mic sampai mengelegar. besarr banget vol suaranya. pagi2 sudah kedengaran, malam2 lebih parah lagi sampai jam 11 malam masih kedengaran. mau menikmati suasana hutan yang tenang jadi enggak bisa gara-gara grafika cikole yang enggak sadar diri. 2malam inap, 2 malam juga merasakan kebisingan. gara-gara grafika cikole , saya enggak lagi deh inap di bobocabin. pihak bobocabin harus bicarakan tuh dengan grafika cikole. tamu mereka jangan sampai acaranya kedengaran sampai bobocabin. knapa harus besar banget suaranya. cukuplah group mereka saja yang dengar , knapa harus sampai semua orang dengar acara mereka.  2 hari inap jadi tambah stres enggak bisa tidur"
Satia Budianti,3.0,"all facilities of bobobox group are always good, including bobocabin cikole. cool air among pine trees and beautiful view of cabins among pine trees, really love it! only one big minus in my opinion: too close to the highway, especially if the venue across from bobocabin holds a noisy event with a booming sound system, it's very disturbing! and added there are buses passing back and forth with their unimportant horn show off, my goodness. my advice, don't stay here during peak season. peak season at bobocabin is okay, because it applies quiet hours and the guests here are not noisy at all. but. visitors to neighboring venues, especially if they are a large group and they have an entertainment stage plus excessive microphone sound, really ruin the atmosphere",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"semua fasilitas bobobox grup always good, termasuk bobocabin cikole ini. udara sejuk di antara pohon pinus dan pemandangan cabin2 di antara pohon pinus yang indah, realy love it!  cuma satu minus besar banget menurut saya : terlalu dekat dengan jalan raya, apalagi kalo venue di seberang bobocabin mengadakan acara yang berisik dengan sound system menggelegar, itu amat sangat mengganggu! dan ditambah ada bus yang lewat mondar mandir dengan show off klakson enggak penting itu, ampun deh.  saran saya, jangan nginep disini pas lagi peak season. peak season di bobocabin is okay, karena menerapkan quite hours dan tamu2 disini enggak ada yang berisik satupun. tapi.pengunjung venue tetangga apalagi kalo grup besar dan mereka ada panggung hiburan plus suara mic yang sudah keterlaluan, benar-benar merusak suasana"

Egi,5.0,"good experience. I enjoyed staying at bobobox and was curious to try bobocabin. turned out to be worth it. new cool atmosphere. soothing scenery. suitable for a short escape from the hustle and bustle. unfortunately there is no restaurant inside. but don't worry, bobocabin collaborates with restaurants/cafes around so we can order food from their partners. but there are certain hours for ordering, not 24 hours. please check the ordering and delivery hours in the menu on the application or ask the CS directly, they will answer in a friendly manner. they also provide bbq and shabu2. can be ordered at any time. for those who forget to bring an umbrella, you can borrow it from the receptionist. but I suggest bringing your own umbrella or poncho. for safety, I suggest choosing a toilet inside. because if you are sleepy at night, you have to walk to the toilet outside, you are a bit afraid of falling because it is dark and there are stairs. but overall it is very fun. I suggest increasing cooperation with providers of typical mountain activities around there. oh yes, online transportation reaches bobocabin cikole. I left by Grab car from Bandung to Bobo Cabin around 2 pm and went home the next day at 12 pm after checking out using GoCar. Maybe don't order an online taxi at night so there will still be a driver to pick you up.",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"good experience. saya senang nginep di bobobox dan penasaran mencoba bobocabin. ternyata worth it. suasana dingin baru. pemandangan menyejukkan hati. cocok untuk pelarian sejenak dari kesibukan.  sayang tidak ada resto di dalamnya. tapi tenang, bobocabin bekerja sama dengan resto/cafe sekitar sehingga kita bisa pesan makanan dari partner mereka. namun ada jam2 tertentu untuk pemesanan, enggak 24 jam. silakan cek dulu jam pemesanan dan pengantaran di menu pada aplikasi atau tanya langsung pada cs, mereka akan jawab dengan ramah.  mereka juga menyediakan bbq dan shabu2. bisa dipesan kapan saja.  bagi yang lupa bawa payung, bisa pinjam ke resepsionis. tapi saya sarankan untum bawa payung atau ponco sendiri.  demi keselamatan, saya sarankan pilih toilet yang di dalam. karena kalo lagi malam2 ngantuk harus jalan ke toilet yang di luar agak takut jatuh ya soalnya gelap dan ada tangga.  tapi overall sangat menyenangkan. saya sarankan perbanyak kerjasama dengan penyedia aktivitas2 khas pegunungan sekitaran situ.  o iya, transportasi online menjangkau bobocabin cikole ya. saya berangkat naik grab car dari bandung ke bobocabin sekitar jam 2 siang dan pulang besoknya jam 12 setelah cekout pakai gocar. mungkin jangan malam2 saja pesan taxi onlinenya agar masih ada driver yang ngambil."

Regina Fransiska,3.0,"some points for bobocabin cikole: 1. the room feels damp and the sheets are not very clean. 2. for the standard room type, the room size is too small, if you bring a suitcase you can't walk. luckily yesterday I only brought a backpack. 3. because the air circulation in the room is only from the opened glass, as a result we can clearly hear the sound of footsteps or people talking clearly. even though there is a curfew, sometimes you can still find neighbors who are still chatting and have to contact the bobocabin chat several times to be reprimanded. 4. there is no tissue provided in the room (you have to ask first) 5. the shared bathroom is not often cleaned. when I wanted to urinate at night the tissue ran out and was not refilled. 6. the food is very lacking. on the menu there are only instant foods and bbq. there are local bobocabin menus, but they were not available when I stayed, so it was useless. finally at 7 am I checked out because I wanted to look for breakfast in the city. hopefully in the future it can improve.",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"beberapa point untuk bobocabin cikole:  1. kamar terasa lembab dan sprei nya kurang bersih.  2. untuk tipe kamar standard, ukuran kamar terlalu kecil, kalau bawa koper jadi enggak bisa jalan. untung kemarin cuma bawa ransel.  3. karena sirkulasi udara kamar hanya dari kaca yang dibuka, akibatnya kita bisa mendengar jelas suara langkah kaki orang atau pun orang yang berbicara terdengar jelas. biarpun ada jam malam yang diberlakukan, tapi tetap kadang bisa kedapatan tetangga yang yang masih mengobrol dan harus beberapa kali contact chat bobox untuk ditegur.  4. di kamar tidak disediakan tissue (harus meminta dulu)  5. kamar mandi sharing tidak sering dibersihkan. pas malam mau buang air kecil tissue habis tidak di refill.  6. makanan kurang banget. di menu hanya ada makanan2 instan dan bbq. ada menu2 lokal bobocabin, tapi tidak tersedia pada saat saya stay, jadi percuma saja. akhirnya jam 7 pagi sudah check out karena mau cari bfast di kota.  semoga ke depan nya bisa improve."

Louisa Kusnandar,4.0,"just returned from our trip at bobo cabin cikole for 3 days. as a family who likes glamping, i always look for a comfortable glamping place, not just beautiful. this time we booked family deluxe, cabin with 2 beds, perfect for 4 people. inside there is a toilet with hot water. the cabin is clean, basic utilities are available (towels, toothbrushes, tea, glasses, water). for hot water and microwave you can go to the main lobby. the bed in bobocabin is comfortable, the atmosphere in the cabin is very cozy. there is mood light, smart window, cabin speaker can be connected to a cellphone so if you play music the sound is good. outside the cabin is also comfortable, there are many pine trees, there is a bonfire area, and the air is a plus point because it is very cold from evening to morning, about 16 degrees celcius. bobo cabin also provides shabu2 and bbq on site. if you bring from home it will obviously be cheaper for food supplies, but those who don't want to bother can order on site, but cook it yourself. overall the stay was nice, we were very satisfied. plus points: - comfortable cabin - not many insects - hot water available, toilet inside for family deluxe negative points: - the food could be more varied for shabu2 and bbq suggestions: - definitely choose a cabin with a toilet inside because it's more comfortable - if possible choose a cabin located near the lobby because it's further from the main road",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"baru kembali dari trip kami di bobo cabin cikole selama 3 hari. sebagai keluarga yang suka glamping, saya selalu mencari tempat glamping yang nyaman, enggak cuma cantik. kali ini kami book family deluxe, cabin dengan 2 kasur, pas untuk 4 orang. di dalammnya ada wc dengan air hangat. cabin-nya bersih, tersedia basic utlities (handuk, sikat gigi, teh, gelas, air putih). untuk air panas dan microwave bisa ke lobby utama.  kasur di bobocabin nyaman, suasana di cabin sangat cozy. ada mood light, smart window, speaker cabin bisa disambungkan dengan handphone jadi kalau setel musik suaranya enak. di luar cabin juga nyaman, banyak pohon pinus, ada bonfire area, dan udaranya plus point karena dingin sekali dari sore ke pagi hari, kira-kira 16 derajat celcius.  bobo cabin juga nyediain shabu2 dan bbq ditempat. kalau bawa dari rumah jelas akan lebih murah untuk perbekalan makanan, tapi yang enggak mau repot bisa pesan ditempat, tapi masak sendiri.  overall staynya enak, kami sangat puas.  plus points: - cabin nyaman - enggak banyak serangga - air panas ada, wc ada di dalam untuk family deluxe  negative points: - masakannya bisa lebih variatif lagi untuk shabu2 dan bbq  suggestion: - definitely pilih cabin yang ada wc di dalam karena lebih nyaman - kalau bisa pilih cabin yang lokasinya di dekat lobby karena lebih jauh dari jalan utama"

Armanto Prasetyo,5.0,"This cikole bobocabin review is actually a long time ago, almost 4 months ago.  the concept of staying in the wild is quite unique, for those who don't want the hassle of opening a tent and so on.  The contour of the land that goes up and down is also good for small sports, expelling the cold. I suggest that you bring a backpack only, not a suitcase. At the end of the day, I had time to see who was carrying the suitcase, why was it so complicated. Yes, it's also called camping, lift lift a little, it's okay.  The family cabins are limited, so you must book well in advance if you want to stay with the same family. if there are many standard cabins, don't worry about running out. except for the holiday season pass.  for food don't worry, if you want you can order via ojol and it will be delivered to your door. as long as you don't ask his brother to hurry, the location is far away.  but in my opinion it's better to bring your own food ingredients from home, bring a portable gas stove and burn it. it feels more like camping.  the cleanliness of the cabin is well maintained, there are ants and small animals roaming around, it's normal, it's also called the forest.",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"review bobocabin cikole ini sudah lama sebenarnya, hampir 4 bulan lalu.  konsep nginep di alam bebas yang cukup unik, buat yang enggak mau ribet buka tenda dan sebagainya.  kontur tanahnya yang naik turun lumayan juga buat olahraga kecil kecilan, mengusir hawa dingin. saran kalo kesini bawanya tas backpack saja, jangan koper. tempo hari sempat lihat yang bawa koper kok ribet geret geretnya. ya namanya juga camping, angkat angkat dikit enggak apa-apa.  kabin family nya terbatas, jadi mesti booking jauh jauh hari kalau mau nginap ramean serumah. kalo kabin yang standar sih banyak, enggak usah kuatir keabisan. kecuali pas musim liburan kali ya.  untuk makanan enggak usah khawatir, kalo mau bisa pesan via ojol juga diantar sampai depan pintu. asal jangan meminta abangnya buru buru ya, lokasi jauh soalnya.  tapi menurut saya better bawa sendiri bahan bahan makanan dari rumah, bawa kompor gas portable lalu bakar bakaran. lebih terasa hawa camping nya.  kebersihan cabin cukup terawat, ada semut dan binatang kecil dikit berkeliaran wajar lah, namanya juga di hutan."

I suggest you bring your own additional food and drinks, especially personal medicines, just in case.. considering the location is far from everywhere. Especially at night outside the Bobo Cabin area, it is very dark, there is no lighting at all. The wifi network is quite smooth. The room is quite clean and sophisticated, the room smells a bit damp but that's normal because it's in the forest.. hehe. *Don't compare it to hotel rooms in general. The shared toilet is also clean and has hot water. The night gets colder, for those who can't stand the cold, bring extra equipment such as thick clothes, socks, jackets. You can also ask for an extra blanket. Oh yeah, don't forget to bring outfits for taking pictures. There are many good photo spots to fill your social media feed. 😆 I don't regret spending the night at bobocabin, it's a new experience. The employees are also friendly and ready to help.",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"awal agak ragu karena baca review ada beberapa kasih bintang 1. tapi di coba saja deh. ternyata tidak seburuk yang di bayangkan. cocok banget untuk ngadem, melepas penat, healing2. jauh dari hingar bingar perkotaan. dari tempat parkir ke lokasi cabin orang lobby memang agak jauh, bagi yang barang bawaannya se abreg, jangan kawatir ada dari pihak bobo yang akan membantu.. proses check ini melalui aplikasi,mudah dan cepat. bisa pesan makanan via aplikasi bobocabin. order untuk bbq /makin malam  sampai jam 5.. makanan di antar jam 7. order untuk sarapan sampai jam 7mlm, makanan akan di antar besok pagi jam 9. saya sarankan lebih baik membawa makanan dan minuman tambahan sendiri terutama obat2 an pribadi, untuk jaga2.. mengingat lokasinya yang jauh kemana mana. terutama malam hari di luar kawasan bobocabin sangat gelap, tidak ada penerangan sama sekali. jaringan wifi cukup lancar. kamar cukup bersih dan canggih, aroma kamar agak lembab tapi ya wajar karena di hutan.. hehe. *jangan membandingan dengan kamar hotel pada umumnya. toilet bersamanya pun bersih ada air hangat. semakin malam semakin dingin, bagi yang tidak kuat udara dingin, bawalah perlengkapan ekstra seperti pakaian yang agak tebal, kaos kaki, jaket.  bisa juga meminta selimbut tambahan.. oh iya jangan lupa juga  bawa perlengkapan outfit untuk foto-foto.. banyak spot foto yang bagus untuk menuhin feed sosmed kalian. 😆  pokoknya enggak menyesal deh bermalam di bobocabin, pengalaman baru. para karywannya pun ramah, dan siap membantu."

Yo Ru,5.0,"hi, for other friends, if you want to come to bobocabin, I suggest you don't bring too many things so that you don't get tired, in this cikole bobocabin, the field is quite hilly so I suggest you don't bring too many things, don't be like me. but this place is highly recommended for those of you who want to find a relaxing place with a forest atmosphere, especially after hours. In the evening, towards the end of the night, there is a very exciting fog. Then in the morning, the atmosphere is very good. But here there are also rules, there are quiet hours starting at 9pm. until the morning if I'm not wrong, but I understand that people who come there are also looking for peace, so we respect the same as other visitors. It's also allowed to order food out there, like grabfood or something else, so those of you who want to go there don't worry about food, they also serve it there. bbq and hotpot packages also have snacks, but for heavy meals other than bbq and hotpot, there is only fiesta instant food, so if you do something urgent, you can also order food at the counter, but it takes a while to arrive, because they cooperate with local cafes and stalls , so I know it's a bit long maybe because of the terrain, but overall it's really good, oh yes, don't forget to try the tea time, I recommend ordering it in the afternoon when the sun is shining, it's really good, the vibes are relaxing while having tea. and they also have a vehicle that makes us want to go to the lobby, it's really cool like a car that does offroad so cool, maybe that's my advice for you who want to try to stay at the bobocabin in cikole.",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"hai buat teman yang lain kalau mau datang ke bobocabin,saya menyarankan jangan bawa barang terlalu banyak soalnya biar enggak capek,di bobocabin cikole ini medannya agak bukit jadi saya menyarankan jangan bawa barang banyak banyak jangan kayak saya. tapi disini tempatnya recomanded banget buat kalian yang pengin mencari tempat santai dengan suasana hutan apalagi pas jam"" sore menjelang malam suka ada kabut seru banget terus pas paginya suasananya enak banget deh. tapi disini juga ada rulesnya juga disana itu ada jam tenang mulai dari jam 9malam sampai pagi kalau enggak salah tapi,maklum sih soalnya yang datang kesana juga buat cari ketenangan jadi kita respect sama sama pengunjung lain. disana juga diperbolehkan pesan makan keluar loh kayak grabfood atau yang lainya jadi kalian yang mau kesana jangan wory soal makanan,disana juga nyediain paket bbq dan hotpot juga loh ada makanan ringan juga tapi buat makanan beratnya selain bbq dan hotpot cuma ada makanan instan fiesta begitu kalau buat yang urgent tapi kalian juga bisa pesan makanan ke counternya tapi datangnya agak lama sih, soalnya mereka kerjasama sama cafe dan warung lokal, jadi maklum agak lama mungkin karena medan juga sih. but overall good banget sih oh iya kalian jangan lupa mencoba tea time nya aku menyarankan pesennya di waktu sore pas matahari lagi bagus bagusnya beh itu enak banget vibesnya nyantai sambil ngeteh. dan mereka juga punya kendaran yang buat ngater kita ke loby keren banget kayak mobil buat offroad begitu keren banget, deh mungkin segitu saja saran dari aku buat kalian yang mau coba nginep ke bobocabin yang di cikole."

Dewi Aprilliani,3.0,"first of all the experience during staying at bobocabin cikole for 1 night sofar really healing from the stress of work in Jakarta. really good for a short vacation here the experience of sleeping in a pine forest with a cold capacity of 19 degrees at night the rainy situation of lembang so you have to bring cold clothes and also thick socks is highly recommended. just a bit confused when I want to check this how to do it, because there is no sign or instructions where to go, there is only security from perhutani who informs that if you want to check this, it turns out that from the first place the car enters you have to turn right and then go up. if the first time then immediately drop the car and go up it will be very far for the check process to the point, yes: *minus* = - no detailed info for check this (too far up to check this) they should have made a check this counter below and there should be a bobocabin person on standby below so that guests are not confused, and check this through their own application and have to register etc. which makes a lot of time wasting. then what is the function of reception then (which is the guest checking this from the application) the chat also takes a long time to reply - the bobocabin people are too indifferent, especially at this check counter (this check out process - check out from the application) and they don't provide detailed information even though there is a chat feature in the bobocabin application.  - the room was damp, the bed and linen smelled (only at the beginning of the check it still smelled good, but when I went to bed at night it smelled really damp like the linen wasn't dry but still used) - they had packages for bbq and suki at prices that were too expensive, I happened to take the suki package for 105 thousand net and I got 250 gr suki meatballs and at first they only had chicken broth seasoning, I asked if there was anything else below there was tomyam yudh I asked for 2 and given but the spices don't suit me. with that price at least there are mushrooms, vegetables or that (in my opinion not worth it to buy) if you buy the chicken package you only get bonless chicken breast plus hot water only (better bring your own) - the counter staff at check out is not friendly (no hospitality industry) it seems like bobocabin should always provide training on how to handle guests check this - check out (the point is not informed at the beginning of the details of check this until check out) - the bathroom (I happened to book an outside bathroom) is a bit too dirty, there should be a house cleaner on standby there because it's really muddy and other guests have taken a shower almost slipped when I wanted to take a shower but luckily I was wearing rubber sandals - sandals are not prepared like hotels (better bring your own) - the door is a bit hard after scanning the barcode (you have to push it really hard to be able to) - positive = - there is a sophisticated feature to blur the windows on their ipad, and there is a feature to change the color of the bedside lamp which is quite interesting - glamping in a pine forest area with very cool air - lots of photo spots near the room and in the forests there - suitable for those of you who like mountain climbing - the air is very cool, get positive energy vibes in the morning, the place is cool, hopefully with some comments from me or other guests, it can be input for bobocabin so that in the future it will be better. not to bring down bobocabin, yes, the input is to improve in terms of comfort for the next guests. thx bobocabin :) warmest gteeting",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"first of all pengalaman selama stay di bobocabin cikole selama 1 malam sofar benar-benar healing dari setress nya pekerjaan di jakarta. oke banget untuk liburan sejenak disini pengalaman tidur di hutan pinus dengan dingin kapasitas 19 derajat di malam hari situasi hujan nya lembang jadi harus bawa baju dingin dan juga kaos kaki tebal sangat dianjurkan.  cuma agak bingung pas mau cek ini harus bagaimana nya, karena enggak ada sign ataupun petunjuk harus kemana nya yang ada hanya security dari perhutani saja yang info kalo mau cek ini ternyata dari tempat pertama mobil masuk harus ambil kanan terus naik. kalo yang pertama kali terus langsung drop mobil terus naik itu akan sangat jauh untuk proses cek ini  to the point saja ya : *minus* = - no info detail for cek ini ( terlalu jauh naik untuk cek ini) harusnya mereka buat cek ini counter di bawah dan harus nya ada orang bobocabin yang stand by di bawah supaya tamu enggak bingung, dan cek ini melalui aplikasi sendiri dan harus registrasi dll yang bikin wasting time banget. lalu fungsi nya sih reception apa kalau begitu (which is tamu cek ini dari aplikasi) chat pun balas nya lama  - orang-orang bobocabin terlalu cuek terutama di counter cek ini ( proses cek ini- cek out dari aplikasi) juga enggak diinfo detail walaupun ada fitur chat di aplikasi bobocabin nya.  - kamar nya lembab, bed dan linen bau (cuma di awal cek ini masih wangi, tapi pas malam mau tidur berasa banget bau lembab seperti linen enggak kering tapi tetap digunakan)  - mereka ada paket untuk bbq dan suki dengan harga yang terlalu mahal, kebetulan saya ambil paket suki dengan harga 105 rbu net yang di dapat bakso suki2 an ukuran 250 gr dan awalnya cuma dikasi bumbu kaldu ayam tok, saya tanya apakah ada lain nya dibawah ada tomyam yudh saya meminta 2 dan dikasi tapi bumbu nya kurang cocok di saya. dengan harga segitu paling enggak ada jamur, sayur ataupun itu (menurut saya no worth it to buy) kalo beli yang paket ayam hanya dapat dada ayam bonless plus air panas only (better bawa sendiri saja)  - petugas counter pada saat cek out enggak ramah (no hospitality industry) seperti nya pihak bobocabin harus selalu adakan training how to handle guest cek ini - cek out (intinya enggak diinfo di awal details cek ini sampai cek out )  - kamar mandi (kebetulan saya pesan yang kamar mandi luar) agak jember banget ya harusnya ada cleaner orang house keping stand by disana karena becek banget dan bekas tamu2 lain mandi hampir kepleset pas mau mandi tapi untung saya pakai sendal karet  - enggak di prepare sendal seperti hotel (better bawa sendiri )  - pintu agak keras setelah scan barcode ( harus benar-benar di dorong keras baru bisa)  - positif =  - ada fitur canggih untuk blur jendela di ipad mereka, dan ada fitur menggantikan warna lampu tidur cukup menarik  - glamping area hutan pinus dengan udara sejuk banget  - banyak spot foto-foto di dekat kamar and di hutan2 sana  - cocok  untuk kalian yang suka naik2 gunung  - udara sejuk banget, dapat energi positif vibes pas pagi, keren lah tempat nya  semoga dengan adanya beberapa komentar dari saya ataupun dari tamu lain nya, bisa jadi masukan untuk bobocabin supaya kedepan nya semakin baik. bukan untuk menjatuhkan bobocabin ya adanya masukan adalah untuk memperbaiki dari segi kenyamanan tamu2 selanjut nya.  thx bobocabin :)  warmest gteeting"

Yesterday I tried turning off the lights, turning on the sound of birds chirping and turning on the transparent windows while sleeping. It's true, my husband and I were already passed out before 8. lol I didn't have time to try the bbq and fire pit. The atmosphere is calm and beautiful. I have a dream of living near a pine forest. 😁",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"seru banget nginep disini, pengalama baru pokoknya. cabin ya kecil banget, but its oke. proses check ini dan check out serta buka kunci semua pakai aplikasi, lampu bisa diatur, ada suara sungai dan hutan, bisa sambung speaker juga, jendelanya  model smart window yang bisa diatur kelihatan atau tidak ya dari luar. kemarin saya coba matiin lampu, nyalain suara kicauan burung dan hidupin jendela model transparan saat tidur.. benaran saja, belum jam 8 saya dan suami sudah tepar.. wkwkwk enggak sempat mencoba bbq dan fire pit. suasana nya tenang dan asri. saya jadi punya cita-cita tinggal di dekat hutan pinus. 😁"
Priscilia Marvel,3.0,"first of all, i stayed at cabin no. 1 (standard cabin without private toilet) for 2 nights. my cabin located near the receptionist but quite far to the public toilet. i think my cabin got the best view from others standard cabins because it's pointed directly to the woods. the reason why i give it 3 star is because of the lack of facilities and signals, also the rate was too overprice. i mean it's pretty but is it worth 1,9mil rupiah for 2 night? i think no. they said to operate the room we just need to use application, but the wi-di was so terrible and it's delaying to open the door. telkomsel provider got no signal there. public toilet was clean but only got 1 room to shower and i think the water heater was broken orang empty because i literally showering with cold water for 2 days and it's around 15°sih so you know how cold the water is 😅 also the bluetooth doesn't work so smooth either. and as for the big window at cabin, it's foggy ini the morning so it's not too clear like what you sih ini the pictures. so overall, it's pretty and it's nice but definitely won't go there again if it's too overprice. because for 800k++room/night it's deserve more facilities.",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"first of all, i stayed at cabin no. 1 (standard cabin without private toilet) for 2 nights. my cabin located near the receptionist but quite far to the public toilet. i think my cabin got the best view from others standard cabins because it's pointed directly to the woods. the reason why i give it 3 star is because of the lack of facilities and signals, also the rate was too overprice. i mean it's pretty but is it worth 1,9mil rupiah for 2 night? i think no. they said to operate the room we just need to use application, but the wi-di was so terrible and it's delaying to open the door. telkomsel provider got no signal there. public toilet was clean but only got 1 room to shower and i think the water heater was broken orang empty because i literally showering with cold water for 2 days and it's around 15°sih so you know how cold the water is 😅 also the bluetooth doesn't work so smooth either. and as for the big window at cabin, it's foggy ini the morning so it's not too clear like what you sih ini the pictures. so overall, it's pretty and it's nice but definitely won't go there again if it's too overprice. because for 800k++room/night it's deserve more facilities."

Rereki Ratikha,4.0,"sudden vacation because of tight schedule, just saw the photo of the place briefly ""oh nice"" so I immediately booked it. After seeing the google maps review, it's not good but I already booked it. I want to share my experience: - So between the lobby, drop off point, and parking lot is far. The road is rocky and uphill. Well, if you stay in a standard cabin, you better bring your stuff too. because the standard cabin is relatively close to the lobby. but if you book a deluxe cabin, it's better to divide the tasks. someone goes to the lobby, someone waits in the parking lot. if the one in the lobby has already got their cabin number, the one waiting in the parking lot just has to go up through the lower entrance. because the deluxe cabin is close to the lower door near the parking lot. so there's no need to bring stuff to the lobby first, even though the deluxe cabin is below. - Don't rely on ordering food via ojol. honestly, it's too far, it's a shame, where is a place like this. it's better to have packed your own food before coming here. the cabin also provides a water heater. can make warm food with soup. - the window can be opened without having to remove all the mosquito curtains. There is a white section on the mosquito curtain that you can just slide to open the window handle.  - If it rains, shoes can be brought inside. there is a shoe rack under the mattress.  - when I was staying, the glass in the cabin fogged up and made the sides of the mattress and cot wet - if you need safety equipment, it's under the mattress. there are helmets, flashlights, etc.  That's all the experience I have. Generally it's fun and aesthetic, ugh. I'm just tired of carrying things when I come in at night, in the rain I'm afraid of tisoledat on the stairs.",a year,Bobocabin Cikole Bandung,"liburan mendadak karena kepepet jadwal, cuma lihat foto tempatnya sekilas ""ih bagus"" yaudah langsung book. udahnya lihat review google maps kok enggak enak tapi sudah keburu booking. mau bagi-bagi pengalaman aku saja:  - jadi antara lobby, drop off point, dan parkiran itu jauh. jalannya bebatuan dan nanjak. nah kalo kamu nginepnya di standard cabin, mending kamu bawa barangnya sekalian. karena standard cabin relatif dekat dari lobby. tapi kalo kamu book di deluxe cabin, mending bagi tugas. ada yang ke lobby seorang, ada yang menunggu di parkiran. kalo yang di lobby sudah dapat nomer kabinnya, yang menunggu di parkiran tinggal naik lewat pintu masuk bawah saja. soalnya kabin duluxe dekat sama pintu bawah dekat parkiran. jadi enggak perlu bawa-bawa barang ke lobby dulu, padahal cabin deluxe di bawah.  - jangan andelin pesan makanan lewat ojol. jujur jauh kasihan, mana tempatnya kayak begini. mending sebelum datang kesini sudah bekel makanan sendiri. di kabin juga disediain pemanas air. bisalah buat makanan anget berkuah mah.  - jendelanya bisa dibuka tanpa harus nyabmbut seluruh tirai nyamuk. dibagian tirai nyamuk itu ada bagian warna putih bisa digeser saja buat buka handle jendela.  - kalo ujan, sepatu bisa dibawa ke dalem. ada rak sepatu dibawah kasur.  - waktu aku nginep kaca di kabin berembun dan bikin basah sisi kasur dan dipannya  - kalo butuh safety equipment ada di bawah kasur. ada helm, senter, dll.  sudah segitu saja sih paling pengalamannya. umumnya sih menyenangkan dan estetik uhuy. cuma capek saja ngangkut barang saja pas datang malam-malam, bari hujan takut tisoledat di tangganya."

Glenn Ronadi,5.0,"Tips: - Dropoff access only fits 1 car so you have to take turns and the road is a bit uphill. The car is parked far away near the Coban Rondo waterfall, then the officer will take you via motorbike to/from the parking lot. - The air in the morning and evening is very cold, so air conditioning is not needed. - The price of snacks and mineral water here is overpriced, it's better to bring complete supplies such as drinking water. Because Indomaret access is far before the Coban Rondo tourist entrance. - Campfire ingredients cost 35 thousand for about 10-20 minutes, can be lit in front of our cabin or there is a campfire spot. You can buy multiples so that the fire burns longer. - The public kitchen only has a microwave and sink. - It says 15 liters of hot water is enough for 2 people, then it takes 90 minutes to reheat. Be wise in using hot water. - The room has a wall tablet to adjust the colored lights, you can install river/forest sound ambiance, and connect as a Bluetooth speaker to play songs via our cellphone. pros: - the view is nice, not blocked by trees, we happened to book ""cabin with a view"" and got cabin number 5. as far as I know we can't request and get it randomly. - the reception staff is quite helpful if there are questions and need help. - when we stayed, the sunrise view was very beautiful around 5 am and above. suitable for sunrise hunters. cons: - the cabin is quite narrow, bags can still be put under the bed there is space, but you need to consider if you bring a large suitcase it will be narrow when opening. - there are board games such as uno, congklak and tentang kita. but the price is around 25 thousand for a full day rental duration. - there is a mini projector that can be rented, but the info is that it is under maintenance when we stayed. - limited breakfast selection, namely Indonesian food, fruit, crackers, tea and coffee.",2 weeks,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"tips: - akses dropoff hanya muat 1 mobil sehingga harus bergantian dan jalannya agak menanjak. mobil pun parkirnya jauh di dekat air terjun coban rondo, nanti diantar petugas via motor ke/dari parkiran. - udara saat pagi dan malam dingin banget, sampai ac enggak diperlukan. - harga snack dan air mineral di sini overpriced, baiknya bawa stok lengkap seperti air minum. karena akses indomaret jauh di sebelum pintu masuk wisata coban rondo. - bahan api unggun harganya 35ribu untuk sekitar 10-20 menit, bisa dinyalakan depan cabin kita atau ada spot api unggun. bisa beli kelipatan supaya api menyala lebih lama. - dapur umum hanya ada microwave dan wastafel. - tertulis air panas sebanyak 15l cukup untuk 2 orang, lalu butuh 90 menit untuk pemanasan kembali. bijaklah dalam pemakaian air hangat. - kamar ada tablet dinding untuk pengaturan lampu warna warni, bisa pasang ambience suara sungai/hutan, dan connect sebagai bluetooth speaker buat setel lagu melalui hp kita.  pros: - view nya bagus tidak terhalang pohon, kebetulan kita book ""cabin with a view"" dan dapat cabin nomor 5. sepengetahuan saya kita tidak bisa request dan dapatnya random. - staff resepsionis cukup helpful jika ada pertanyaan dan perlu bantuan. - saat kita stay, sunrise view nya sangat indah menjelang jam 5 pagi ke atas. cocok untuk para sunrise hunters.  cons: - cabin cukup sempit, tas masih bisa ditaruh bawah ranjang ada spacenya, tapi perlu pertimbangkan kalau bawa koper besar akan sempit saat membuka. - ada board games seperti uno, congklak dan tentang kita. tapi harganya sekitar 25 ribu untuk durasi sewa seharian. - ada mini projector bisa disewa, tapi info nya sedang maintenance saat kita stay. - seleksi sarapan terbatas, yaitu indonesian food, buah, kerupuk, teh dan kopi."
Edy s,3.0,"I'm staying after Eid al-Adha 2024, according to me it would be better if the room size were enlarged, e.g. longer than 1m..width 0.5m..bathroom added 0.5m..so the effect is not cramped..narrow. and it's more suitable for the middle segment.. not like camping in the forest in the past. enough to stay here 1x.. unless there is a bigger room",2 weeks,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"saya nginap setelah idul adha 2024, menurut saya akan lebih bagus ukuran kamar diperbesar, mis panjang tbh 1m..lebar 0.5m..kamar mandi ditambah 0.5m..jadi kesan nya enggak pas-pasan..sempit2an. dan lebih cocok lu segmen menengah..tidak seperti kemping2an dihutan jaman dulu. cukup 1x nginap disini..kecuali ada kamar yang lebih besar"
felisha nismara,3.0,"from the beginning, I wanted to check in and waited a while because there was a problem with the server/application, but the receptionist was quite helpful in finding another solution. I think the room facilities are lacking for the price of one million per night, they don't give slippers even though the floor is cold, there is no TV and you have to rent a projector and pay again. There are only 2 pillows per room for 2 people, so it's not very comfortable for me who needs 2 pillows when sleeping. But if you are looking for the room experience and the view, it's worth it. Maybe the breakfast can be improved because it tastes very bland, the menu is also limited, and the food served is cold.",3 weeks,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"dari awal mau checkin menunggu agak lama karena ada trouble dari server/aplikasinya, tapi receptionist cukup membantu mencarikan solusi lain. fasilitas kamarnya menurutku kurang ya untuk harga sejutaan permalem, enggak dikasih slipper padahal lantainya dingin, enggak ada tv juga harus nyewa proyektor bayar lagi. bantal juga cuma dapat 2 perkamar untuk 2 orang, jadi kurang nyaman banget buat aku yang kalo tidur bantalnya harus 2. tapi kalo kalian mencari experience kamar dan viewnya cukup worth it. buat sarapannya mungkin bisa diperbaiki lagi ya karena rasanya sangat hambar, menu juga terbatas, dan makanan yang disajikan dingin."

Abdul Latif,5.0,"an amazing experience to sleep with family in a small cabin in the mountains. I stayed with my family on May 20-21, 2024. the cabin is comfortable, king bed, futuristic, nice view. the weather around is very comfortable and cool. there are some things that need to be improved: 1. soap/shampoo instructions in the bathroom. yesterday when I stayed there were no instructions, so I was worried about using it because I was afraid of getting it mixed up 2. cleanliness of the glass in the roof/outside area. yesterday the dust and crust stuck to the glass until it turned black when wiped with my fingers. 3. breakfast menu and side dishes. yesterday 1 person was limited to a maximum of 2 side dishes of small pieces of chicken with sweet and sour sauce, there was no choice for the menu for guests with allergies/others.",a month,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"pengalaman yang luar biasa untuk tidur bersama keluarga di kabin kecil daerah pegunungan. saya menginap bersama keluarga tanggal 20-21 mei 2024. kabinnya nyaman, king bed, futuristik, pemandangan bagus. cuaca sekitar sangat nyaman dan sejuk. ada beberapa yang harus ditingkatkan: 1. petunjuk sabun/sampo di kamar mandi. kemarin saat menginap tidak ada petunjuk, jadi khawatir mau memakai karena takut tertukar 2. kebersihan kaca-kaca area atap/luar. kemarin debu dan keraknya menempel di kaca hingga menghitam saat disapu pakai jari. 3. menu sarapan dan lauk. kemarin 1 orang dibatasi maksimal 2 lauk potongan kecil ayam tepung saos asam manis, tidak ada pilihan untuk menu bagi tamu yang alergi/lainnya."

Dedi Eko,4.0,"vacation while stayingcation in a high altitude and cool air has become an option for residents or tourists in various places. around Malang, precisely in the Coban Rondo tourist area, there is a unique inn to try. and that day we had the opportunity to stay even though it was only one night here. although it is only two years old, this inn is almost always fully booked especially on weekends, especially during the holiday season. if the plan is certain, then booking it well in advance is necessary, especially if there is a discount or promo there. because it is located in a tourist attraction, then for prospective inns the same thing will be applied as other tourist visitors, namely by buying an entrance ticket of around IDR 40,000 per person and vehicle parking fees. from the gate of the tourist attraction, to get to the inn it takes about 15 minutes by vehicle while passing through winding roads, going up and down with panoramic views of trees on the left and right. although the access road to the location is quite good, vigilance still needs to be given because there is a steep ravine on one side of the road. there is a parking area that is not too large around the lobby. but it can only be used for lowering and raising. and this may be the less comfortable thing about this inn. after doing the drop-off, the vehicle must go back down to park at the tourist location. indeed there will be a hotel officer who will pick you up, but it will still be an obstacle, especially for those who will walk out of the inn. the first impression when you arrive at the location is a cool, clean, neat and organized atmosphere. the cabin building is well arranged with an ideal distance between one and another. the road access is covered in concrete and follows the contour of the land, so sometimes it goes up and sometimes down. the check-in process is quite easy and fast. a special qr will be given through me/a as access to enter the room. because there is no key anymore, so it's a good idea to share the qr access with family members who are participating. there are two types of cabins available. cabin type for four and two. entering the cabin, it turns out that the size is not as big as it looks outside. of course because there is a bathroom inside. so the cabin is really compact and leaves a little space to spread out a prayer mat. besides the lighting can be adjusted in color and intensity, the room in the cabin has a glass that is large enough to see the area below. and coincidentally the view from our room directly faces the valley where the songgoriti area is there. because it is a smart / switch glass type, the glass can be adjusted to the level of opacity or clarity as needed. the bathroom is available with a rather small size, but it is enough for a shower. and importantly, a heater is available so you can shower using warm water. towels and amenities are available in the bathroom. meanwhile a water heater for making coffee is available near the bed. suitable for making hot drinks or instant noodles. jackets must be brought and worn here. because even though it is only 16.00 in the afternoon, the cold air has started to come. coupled with the fairly strong afternoon air gusts. but that is also the right time to enjoy the outdoor panorama, namely when the lights start to light up so that the afternoon and evening atmosphere becomes even cooler. likewise in the morning after dawn until sunrise. several facilities such as communal areas, viewpoints and campfire areas are available and can be enjoyed. but only until 21.00, because after that everyone must maintain peace and avoid excessive noise. that's the rule here. Apart from snacks and mineral water, there is no food available at this inn, unless you order it in advance. So bringing provisions to be processed or cooked is very important, especially for dinner and breakfast.",a month,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"liburan sambil staycation di tempat berketinggian dan berudara sejuk telah menjadi pilihan bagi warga ataupun wisatawan di berbagai tempat. di sekitaran malang, tepatnya di area wisata coban rondo, terdapat penginapan yang unik untuk dicoba. dan hari itu kami berkesempatan untuk menginap meskipun cuma semalam di sini.  meski baru berusia dua tahun, tempat penginapan ini hampir selalu fully-booked terutama di setiap akhir pekan, apalagi di musim liburan. jika rencana sudah pasti, maka memesannya jauh-jauh hari perlu untuk dilakukan, apalagi jika sedang ada diskon atau promo di sana.  karena berada di lokasi obyek wisata, maka bagi calon penginap akan diterapkan hal yang sama dengan pengunjung wisata lainnya yaitu dengan membeli tiket masuk sekitar rp. 40.000 per orang serta biaya parkir kendaraan.  dari gerbang obyek wisata, untuk menuju penginapan kira-kira butuh sekitar 15 menit perjalanan dengan kendaraan sambil melewati jalanan yang berkelok, naik-turun dengan panorama pepohonan di kiri kanannya. meski jalanan akses ke lokasi cukup baik, kewaspadaan tetap perlu diberikan karena jurang yang curam ada di salah satu sisi jalan.  terdapat area parkir yang tidak terlalu luas di sekitaran lobby. namun itu hanya boleh digunakan untuk menurunkan dan menaikkan saja. dan ini mungkin merupakan hal yang kurang nyaman dari penginapan ini. setelah melakukan drop-off, kendaraan harus turun kembali ke bawah untuk parkir di lokasi wisata. memang akan ada petugas hotek yang melakukan penjemputan, namun tetap saja akan menjadi hambatan terutama untuk mereka yang akan jalan-jalan keluar lokasi penginapan.  kesan pertama begitu sampai di lokasi adalah suasana yang sejuk, bersih, rapi dan tertata. bangunan kabin tertata dengan baik dengan jarak yang ideal antara satu dengan lainnya. akses jalannya berlapis beton dan mengikuti kontur tanah, sehingga terkadang naik dan terkadang turun.  proses check-ini cukup mudah dan cepat. qr khusus akan diberikan melalui gue/a sebagai akses untuk masuk ke kamar. karena tidak ada kunci lagi, jadi ada baiknya qr akses di-share dengan anggota keluarga yang ikut serta.  ada dua tipe kabin yang tersedia. tipe kabin untuk berempat dan berdua.  masuk ke dalam kabin, ternyata ukurannya tak sebesar seperti tampak luarnya. tentu saja karena terdapat kamar mandi di dalamnya. sehingga kabin benar-benar compact dan menyisakan sedikit space untuk menggelar sajadah.  selain pencahayaannya bisa diatur warna dan intensitasnya, kamar di kabinnya terdapat kaca yang cukup besar untuk memandang area di bawahnya. dan kebetulan view dari kamar kami langsung menghadap ke lembah di mana area songgoriti ada di sana. karena berjenis smart / switch glass, maka kaca tersebut dapat diatur tingkat keburaman maupun kebeningannya sesuai kebutuhan.  kamar mandi tersedia dengan ukuran yang agak kecil, namun cukuplah untuk mandi. dan yang penting, tersedia heater sehingga bisa mandi dengan menggunakan air hangat. handuk dan amenities tersedia di kamar mandi. sementara itu pemanas air untuk membuat kopi tersedia di dekat tempat tidurnya. cocoklah untuk membuat minuman panas maupun mie instan.  jaket mesti dibawa dan dikenakan di sini. karena meski baru jam 16.00 sore hari, udara dingin sudah mulai datang. ditambah lagi dengan hembusan udara sore yang lumayan kencang.  namun itu juga merupakan saat yang pas untuk menikmati panorama luar ruanganan yaitu tatkala lampu-lampu mulai menerangi sehingga suasana sore dan petang menjadi semakin keren. begitupun di pagi hari selepas subuh hingga terbitnya matahari.  beberapa fasilitas seperti area communal, titik pandang dan area api unggun tersedia dan bisa dinikmati. namun hanya sampai jam 21.00 saja, karena setelah itu semuanya harus saling menjaga ketenangan dan mengindari keberisikan yang berlebih. begitu aturan di sini.  selain snack dan air mineral, tidaklah tersedia makanan di penginapan ini, kecuali dengan memesannya terlebih dahulu. jadi membawa bekal untuk diolah atau dimasak adalah hal yang sangat penting, terutama untuk makan malam dan sarapan pagi."

Willi Tjandra,5.0,"the room is interesting and gives its own impression, because the theme is cabin so it is indeed a bit small.. because it is quite cold, unfortunately the air conditioner when tried to be set to warmer did not work.. so it is better if you bring a blanket or long pants when sleeping. for those who can't stand the cold.. at night there must be a place for a fire, and there is firewood sold per bundle.. 3 bundles can last for 45 minutes - 1 hour. The strange thing is when going to the hotel, we were stopped at the entrance gate of the Coban Rondo tourist attraction, charged per person in the car.. in my opinion it is a bit strange.. if we stay overnight it should have been included.. but fortunately it can be used in the morning to enter the waterfall. be careful on the road when it is foggy at night, if the white light does not penetrate the fog, use the yellow fog lamp. and it will be more fun if you stay with several families or friends, because the children will be able to play together.",11 months,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"kamarnya menarik dan memberikan kesan tersendiri, karena memang temanya cabin jadi memang agak kecil.. karena cukup dingin, sayangnya acnya waktu dicoba diset jadi penghangat enggak bisa.. jadi lebih baik kalo bawa selimut atau celana panjang waktu tidur. bagi yang enggak kuat dingin..  waktu malam harus disediakan tempat bakaran, dan ada kayu bakar yang dijual perikat.. 3 ikat bisa untuk 45 menit - 1 jam  yang aneh waktu menuju ke hotel di stop di gate masuk wisata coban rondo, kena per orang yang di dalam mobil.. menurut saya agak aneh.. harusnya kalo nginep kita sudah include.. tapi untungnya bisa digunakan di pagi harinya untuk masuk ke air terjun.  hati-hati di jalan waktu berkabut di malam hari, kalo lampu putih sinarnya enggak tembus kabut, pakai fog lamp yang kuning. dan akan lebih seru kalo menginap dengan beberapa keluarga sodara ataupun teman, karena anak-anak akan bisa bermain bareng."

Muh Syarifuddin,5.0,"stayed here to celebrate my wife's wedding anniversary and birthday. Because I'm used to hotels, I wanted to find something different, namely glamping in the mountains. The view is nice, especially at night you can see the city lights from the room (if it's not foggy). In the morning you can see the sunrise. I got a room in cabin 7, the view is pretty good. It's not very spacious, but it's enough for two people. If you want full facilities and spacious, please go to a hotel. Don't compare the size of the room. You can order food via the bobobox application. It is recommended to bring your own food from outside because once you're at the location you're too lazy to go out again. The car park is far away but there is a delivery facility by the bobocabin crew. I really enjoyed staying here.",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"menginap disini untuk merayakan wedding anniv dan bday istri. karena sudah terbiasa dengan hotel, ingin cari sesuatu yang beda yakni glamping di pegunungan. view bagus, apalagi kalau malam hari bisa lihat city light dari kamar (bila tidak berkabut). pagi bisa lihat sunrise. dapat kamar di cabin 7 lumayan oke viewnya. memang tidak luas banget, tapi cukup lah untuk berdua. kalau mau full fasilitas dan luas silakan ke hotel saja. jangan bandingkan masalah luas kamar. pesan makanan bisa via aplikasi bobobox. disarankan bawa makanan sendiri juga dari luar karena kalau sudah di lokasi malas buat keluar lagi. parkir mobil jauh tapi ada fasilitas pengantaran oleh crew bobocabin. senang sekali menginap disini."

FAKHMA ZAKKI RAMADHANI,5.0,"the concept is indeed camping. so those who expect to get star hotel facilities will definitely be different. but the service is still extraordinary, don't doubt it. everyone is very friendly, from the security guard, receptionist, to the helper. for small children aged 1 year old it is very fun but must always be alert because the conditions are up and down (it's called the mountains). you can order a bbq including the grill. if you bring your own equipment it is highly recommended so you can save money. hehe. just order the firewood. you can light it or light it yourself. the system is actually self-service. so you are free to reach out. there is only quiet time, so after quiet time don't be noisy. at night the air is very cold, especially for children so don't forget to bring a jacket. for those who like camping like me, this place is really a calming place and can be a recommendation to relieve work fatigue. of course I, my children and wife will come back again.",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"konsepnya memang camping ya. jadi yang berharap dapat fasilitas hotel berbintang jelas akan berbeda. tapi pelayanannya tetap luar biasa jangan diragukan. semuanya sangat bersahabat, mulai dari satpam, resepsionis, hingga helpernya.  untuk anak kecil usia 1 tahun sangat menyenangkan namun harus selalu waspada karena kondisinya naik turun(namanya juga digunung).  bisa pesan bbq sudah termasuk alat panggangnya. kalau membawa alat sendiri sangat disarankan sehingga bisa berhemat. hehe. tinggal memesan kayu bakarnya. ingin dinyalakan atau nyalakan sendiri juga boleh.  sistemnya sebenarnya self service ya. jadi bebas mau mengapai saja. cuma ada jam tenang, jadi setelah jam tenang jangan berisik. saat malam udara dingin sekali, terutama bagi anak-anak jadi jangan lupa membawa jaket.  bagi yang senang camping seperti saya tempat ini benar-benar tempat yang menenangkan dan bisa jadi rekomendasi untuk menghilangkan kepenatan kerja. tentu saya beserta anak dan istri akan kembali lagi."

Diana Santoso,4.0,"the place is beautiful, the road to get there is relatively smooth and the terrain is good, easy to reach. as complex as the coban rondo waterfall, you have to pay the coban rondo entrance ticket first. the place is remote and there are only cafes & small stalls around the waterfall, the parking lot is also far away, so it is recommended to bring lots of food & especially drinking water. but don't worry, bobocabin also sells heavy meals and snacks if you don't prepare to bring any supplies. we stayed in a deluxe cabin with a view. the room is very small, smaller than a hotel room in general, amenities are only for 2 people, so if you bring children, you should bring more towels. toilet amenities are also very limited, it is recommended to bring your own plastic / paper cup for brushing your teeth. the cabin I stayed in happened to face east so in the morning the sun was very bright & hot because it shone directly on us. the night was quite cold, up to 20 °, if you come from a hot city it might feel cold so prepare a jacket. in the cabin itself the blankets were enough. the mattress was quite thin & hard unfortunately. cabin cleanliness could be improved, my place was dusty in some places. service was very good & responsive, spacious, clean, well maintained.",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"tempatnya indah, jalan ke sana relatif lancar dan medannya bagus, mudah dicapai. sekompleks dengan air terjun coban rondo, masuk harus bayar tiket masuk coban rondo dulu. tempat terpencil dan hanya ada kafe2 & warung2 kecil di sekitar air terjun, parkiran juga jauh, jadi saran bawa makanan yang banyak & terutama air minum. tapi jangan khawatir, bobocabin juga jual makanan berat dan snack2 semisal tidak persiapan bawa bekal apa-apa. kami menginap di deluxe cabin with a view. kamar sangat kecil, lebih kecil dari kamar hotel pada umumnya, amenities hanya untuk 2 orang, jadi kalau bawa anak sebaiknya bawa handuk lebih. amenities toilet juga sangat terbatas, disarankan bawa gelas plastik / kertas sendiri untuk sikat gigi. kabin yang saya tempati kebetulan menghadap timur jadi pas pagi matahari silau banget & panas karena langsung nyentrong menyinari kita. malam hari cukup dingin, sampai 20°sih, kalau dari kota berhawa panas mungkin akan berasa dingin jadi siapkan jaket. di dalam kabin sendiri selimut yang ada sudah cukup. kasurnya cukup tipis & keras sayangnya. kebersihan kabin mungkin bisa ditingkatkan, tempat saya berdebu di beberapa tempat. layanan sangat baik & responsif, tempat luas, bersih, terpelihara dengan baik."
Sepulang Senja,5.0,"It's really great, an extraordinary staycation experience, calm and peaceful away from the hustle and bustle of the city, at night you can hear the sound of beetles, it's really peaceful. I stayed there to prepare a barbequean from home, so even if there is no breakfast (there is if you order or outside the overnight package), there is a quiet hour from 9pm to 7am, all facilities are digitized. don't forget to install the bobocabin application before going there because the room key is from the application, it's really cool, right? the only drawback is that the car park is not attached. not afraid of getting lost or anything, more towards the stuff, there's a lot of stuff in the car, so if something gets left behind, it's a little scary. the rest is nice. very suitable as a gift for the newlyweds",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"mantab banget, pengalaman staycation yang luar biasa tenang damai pergi dari hiruk pikuk perkotaan, di malam hari kedengaran suara kumbang benar benar damai banget. aku nginep disana prepare barbequean dari rumah jadi even enggak ada sarapan (ada kalo pesan atau diluar paket menginap), ada jam tenang dari jam 9 malam sampai jam 7 pagi, semua fasilitas digitalize. jangan lupa instal aplikasi bobocabin sebelum kesana karena kunci kamar dari aplikasi, kerem banget kan. kekurangannya cuma parkiran mobil enggak menempel. bukan takut hilang atau apa sih lebih ke arah barang barang banyak di mobil jadi kalo ada yang ketinggalan agak keteran saja. sisanya nice. cocok banget banget buat kado pengantin baru"
Dwi Herni,5.0,"first time here, yesterday - yesterday just saw on tiktok & reels that were floating around on the veranda. still just opened last year, the place is aesthetic surrounded by pine trees. first enter here we unload all the suitcases etc, after that the car is parked in the upper parking lot, if we go back to the hotel we are taken by the hotel staff on a motorbike, the road access from the hotel to the parking lot is narrow because it is only enough for one car to pass and the road is uphill, because the hotel is above. there are 2 types of cottages / cabins, deluxe king rooms & family queen rooms. yesterday I was in a deluxe king room, because the concept is a cabin so it is not as spacious as in a hotel room, the bed is also not soft enough so it is not comfortable, the bathroom is narrow. but for the view in the room is indeed the best, you can see the beauty of Batu City from the room. not all of them get a view like this, if you want to stay overnight choose one with a view of Batu City. the room lights are also my child's favorite, the colors can be changed. at @bobocabin they don't provide breakfast, so if we are hungry we buy it ourselves outside. in the lobby only provide snacks. There is a place for a group berbeque, but we bring our own berbeque tools and materials. So in my opinion, it would be nice if a group of people came here, we could have fun grilling together.",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"pertama kali kesini, kemarin - kemarin hanya lihat di tiktok & reels yang bersliweran di beranda. masih baru buka tahun kemarin, tempatnya aesthetic dikelilingi pohon pinus. pertama masuk kesini kita menurunkan semua koper dll, setelah itu mobil di parkir di parkiran atas, kalau balik ke hotel kita dibonceng sama petugas hotel naik motor, akses jalan dari hotel ke parkiran sempit ya karena hanya cukup dilewati satu mobil saja dan jalannya menanjak, karena memang hotelnya berada diatas. tersedia 2 macam cottage/cabin kamar deluxe king & kamar family queen. saya kemarin di kamar deluxe king, karena konsepnya cabin jadi memang enggak seluas di kamar hotel, tempat tidur nya juga kurang empuk jadi enggak nyaman, kamar mandi sempit. tapi untuk view di kamarnya memang juara sih bisa lihat keindahan kota batu dari kamar. ini enggak semua ya dapat view begini, kalau pengin nginep pilih dengan view kota batu. lampu kamar juga jadi favorite anak saya, bisa diubah2 warnanya. di @bobocabin tidak menyediakan sarapan ya, jadi kalau kita laper kita beli sendiri diluar. di lobby hanya menyediakan snack saja. ada tempat buat berbeque rame rame, tapi untuk alat dan bahan berbeque kita bawa sendiri. jadi menurut aku kalau kesini enaknya rame-rame, kita bisa seru- seru-seruan bakar2 bareng."

Andrianus Abdipranoto,5.0,"I checked in on January 10, 2023, was greeted very well & friendly by the security guard Mr. Ilham and the receptionist staff Ms. Anissa. Mr. Ilham who helped with the car parking process and Ms. Anissa explained the check-in process very well via the app. Honestly, I was worried before because there were several reviews about the staff who were not good. But it turns out, based on what I experienced, maybe there have been improvements from the management. For the cabin unit itself, in my opinion it is very good. The condition is all clean. For hot water, it is not unlimited, there is information on the bathroom wall. But for me, my wife and one toddler, the hot water is enough. The temperature at night when I stayed reached 14°, the fog had descended. When the fog cleared, I was accompanied by a stretch of stars in the sky. Something that is very difficult for me to get in the city we live in. So refreshing. At 5.10 in the morning, I woke up to see the sunrise. There is indeed no TV in the cabin unit, but the wifi connection is very good. I highly recommend staying here for two nights to be able to enjoy the natural atmosphere there. Healing, more or less the right word to represent this residence. a little advice, bring your favorite coffee so we can brew it there and accompany us to enjoy the cold atmosphere. in my opinion this bobocabin is an exclusive glamping, not a luxury resort with all its facilities. so before we book, we should first determine and study our and our family's needs. i am not the type of review writer, either on google or any platform. but my experience at bobocabin coban rondo was very impressive, and honestly a bit contrary to some previous reviews. without reducing my respect for previous guests who may feel there are shortcomings, but these things should still be a concern for management to consistently provide perfect service in the future. thank you. i personally will stay at bobocabin coban rondo again when i visit batu. in the near future, i plan to stay at bobocabin gunung mas puncak, which is closer to the city where i live. hopefully it will be as satisfying as i felt yesterday.",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"saya check ini 10 januari 2023, disambut dengan sangat baik & ramah oleh security pak ilham dan staff resepsionis kak anissa. pak ilham yang membantu proses parkir mobil dan kak anissa dengan sangat baik menjelaskan proses check ini lewat apps. jujur sebelumnya sempat khawatir karena sempat ada beberapa review mengenai staff yang kurang baik. tapi ternyata, berdasarkan yang saya alami, mungkin sudah ada perbaikan dari pihak management. untuk unit cabin nya sendiri, menurut saya sangat baik. kondisinya semua bersih. untuk air hangat memang tidak unlimited, sudah ada info tertera di dinding kamar mandi. tapi untuk saya, istri dan satu anak balita, air hangatnya cukup. suhu di malam saat saya menginap mencapai 14°, kabut sempat turun. saat kabut hilang, saya ditemani hamparan bintang di langit. sesuatu yang sangat sulit  saya dapatkan di kota kami tinggal. so refreshing. pagi jam 5.10, saya bangun untuk melihat sunrise. memang tidak ada tv di unit cabin, tapi koneksi wifi sangat baik. saya sangat merekomendasikan untuk menginap di sini dua malam untuk lebih bisa menikmati suasana alam di sana. healing, kurang lebih kata yang tepat untuk merepresentasikan hunian ini. sedikit saran, bawa kopi kesukaan untuk bisa kita brew di sana dan temani kita menikmati suasana dingin. menurut saya bobocabin ini adalah exclusive glamping, bukan resort mewah dengan segala fasilitasnya. jadi sebelum kita booking, sebaiknya tentukan dan pelajari dulu kebutuhan kita dan keluarga. saya bukan tipe penulis review, baik di google atau platform manapun. namun pengalaman saya di bobocabin coban rondo sangat impressive, dan jujur agak bertolak belakang dengan beberapa review sebelumnya. tanpa mengurangi rasa hormat saya kepada tamu-tamu sebelumnya yang mungkin merasa ada kekurangan, namun hal-hal tersebut baiknya tetap menjadi perhatian management untuk secara konsisten memberikan service sempurna di masa yang akan datang. terima kasih. saya pribadi akan kembali menginap di bobocabin coban rondo saat saya berkunjung ke batu. dalam waktu dekat, saya berencana menginap di bobocabin gunung mas puncak, yang lebih dekat dengan kota saya tinggal. semoga sama memuaskannya seperti yang saya rasakan kemarin."

Lynn F,5.0,"stayed on New Year's Eve with a fairly pricey price for a family cabin that we booked 3 months in advance. chose to stay at bobocabin coban rondo because we wanted to experience staying in nature with the kids after 2 days of playing in the crowd and staying at golden tulip and pohon inn. so yes we quite enjoyed our experience with a natural view that made it hard to move on. got complimentary bbq and firewood that we didn't have time to use because it rained heavily and was windy that night. experienced an unforgettable sensation because of the pine tree branches that fell on the cabin and the heavy rain. the staff was quite helpful when we arrived, helped carry our luggage, quite communicative when chatting on wa. hot water and air conditioning were also good. so choosing to stay here was a choice and we quite enjoyed the sensation, if there are those who then have too high expectations, just choose another inn or villa :-di",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"menginap pas malam tahun baru dengan harga yang cukup pricey untuk family cabin yang kami pesan 3 bulan sebelumnya. memilih untuk menginap di bobocabin coban rondo ini karena ingin merasakan pengalaman menginap di alam bersama anak-anak setelah 2 hari sebelumnya puas main di keramaian dan menginap di golden tulip dan pohon inn. jadi ya kami cukup menikmati pengalaman kami dengan view alam yang bikin susah move on sih. dapat complimentary bbq dan kayu api yang tidak sempat kami pakai karena pas malamnya hujan deras dan berangin. ngalamin sensasi yang tak terlupakan karena ranting2 pohon pinus yang berjatuhan di atas kabin dan hujan yang cukup deras. staf cukup helpfull pas kami datang, membantu membawakan bawaan kami, cukup komunikatif waktu chat di wa. air panas dan ac juga baik. jadi memang memilih menginap disini adalah pilihan sih dan kami cukup menikmati sensasinya, kalau ada yang kemudian terlalu high expectation ya pilih saja penginapan atau villa yang lain :-di"

A'innafa Idatun N.S,1.0,"with a fairly high price, it feels like you don't get satisfactory facilities and services, a bit disappointed, you could say that the facilities and services are lacking. the service is not very friendly, very slow, the room is cramped, ordering barbecue for more than 2 hours has not been delivered, you also have to pay the counter again to enter, even though the price is 1.4, you thought it included the counter, but it didn't. the point is, there needs to be a lot of evaluation for this cabin. the only plus is the view, apart from that it is very lacking",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"dengan harga yang lumayan, rasanya tidk dapat fasilitas dan pelayanan yang memuaskan, agak kecewa sih, bisa dibilang kurang sekali untuk fasilitas dan pelayanannya. pelayanannya kurang ramah, sangat lama, kamar sempit, pesan berbbq 2 jam lebih belum diantar juga, masuk juga harus bayar loket lagi, padal harganya 1,4 mengira sudah termasuk loket ternyata enggak. intinya perlu banyak evaluasi untuk cabin ini. plus nya hanya bagus di view saja, selain itu sangat kurang sekali"

Yulia Sumarna,2.0,"Yesterday I went there, when it was raining heavily all night. There was only 1 employee who helped carry the suitcase and had to queue first. There was no canopy on the way. When I got to the cabin, my clothes were soaked. I wanted to order BBQ but I was confused about how to grill it because it was raining heavily, and I couldn't even request it to be grilled. The parking lot was far from the location so I just sat in the cabin during the rain. There was no TV, it was really boring. The deluxe cabin was also really small. The concept is okay, but we need to think about what the solution is when it rains? There should also be ready-to-eat food. Not just instant food, the service is less than satisfactory because there are only a few employees. Human resources are inadequate.",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"kemarin saya kesana, pas lagi hujan deras semalaman. pegawai yang bantu bawain koper cuman 1 itupun mesti antri dulu. di jalannya tidak ada kanopi sama sekali. sampai kabin baju basah kuyup. mau pesan bbq bingung manggangnya karena hujan deras,request dipanggangkan juga tidak bisa. tempat parkir jauh dari lokasi jadi selama hujan cuma bengong saja di cabin. tidak ada tv,boring banget. mana cabin yang deluxe juga kecil banget. konsepnya sih ok, cuma perlu dipikirkan bila hujan bagaimana solusinya? mestinya juga disediakan makanan siap saji. bukan cuma makanan instan saja, service kurang memuaskan karena pegawai cuma sedikit. sdm kurang memadai."

It's an exciting experience to stay there if it's not rainy season so you can go for a night walk with a big bonfire too",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"dapat yang viewnya lumayan, cuma mending bawa sendiri alat buat grill sama bahan2nya karena disana cukup pricey sih, aku beli yang 200rb dapat wagyu yang bulat untuk berdua. pengalaman menginap yang seru kalo bisa jangan musim hujan kesananya biar bisa jalan malam nyalain api unggun yang gede juga"

meeya sabrina,5.0,"its a whole great experience, I arrived at 3.30 pm, the atmosphere was foggy, it seemed like the location of the inn was in the clouds, I came with my child and husband, by booking a family cabin and was placed in pod 3, the very end and the location was windy compared to the other 4 family cabins, but I like it because privacy is maintained, the location of this inn is very beautiful, very charming, when it's foggy the atmosphere is warm. This family cabin can be occupied by 4 adults + 2 children, in the room there are 2 identical proper mattresses (all sheets and blankets are fragrant, the mattress is not too soft but not too hard either), 4 bottles of 600ml Vit brand mineral water, 4 toothbrushes, 4 towels, 4 teas + sugar, 4 cups, for amenities it is not as complete as a hotel with the same price, but of course, what bobocabin sells is the experience of staying in the mountains comfortably, the atmosphere, very very quiet, very suitable for refreshing from the toxic office conditions 🤣. in the lobby there is only 1 small table for the receptionist who is also only 1 person, so when I came and happened to have 4 other rooms that also wanted to check in, so I had to queue to check in (I apologize when checking in the receptionist was not very friendly, but when I checked out and the position was quiet, the lady was friendly and smiled very sweetly, as for the security, they are champions, communicative and friendly). the control system in this room is a smart cabin, the lights, locks, and windows in this inn can be adjusted via the bobobox application which must be installed for guests who will stay here, the room key is only scanned from the qr code, the window in our room had a bug, but by chatting in the application, the inn staff can immediately restart the system in the room. we were lucky to come in a foggy atmosphere and light rain, so we got a misty view, then at 3.30 am when the fog cleared, the view of Batu City was very charming for us. very beautiful. from the inn you can order bbq + cooking utensils, but its quite pricey so i only order for breakfast, before checking in i had brought food from the stall below, and complete snacks for my child, also fruits, milk, cup noodles, boiled eggs (i googled it said there is no restaurant in this inn), so when i was in the inn i was not hungry hehe. in this inn there is a common kitchen which has dishwashing facilities and 2 microwaves (can heat rice, pempek and rawon from the stall below 🎉) there are also soft drinks for sale, then there are books that can be read for free and the choice of books is wow, not many but quality, i saw haenim sutmin, murakami, and paulo coelho in the cabinet in the kitchen 🤭. to enter the coban rondo area, you have to pay 25k per person and 10k for vehicles. if there is one thing that is a bit disappointing, I think it is the American breakfast menu which is priced at 115k, the quantity is small and what we got is different from what is on the menu, it said that we would get mashed potatoes, but what we got was potato wedges, then in the morning, there were so many flies outside the room that even rushed into the room, it was really annoying. around the hotel, in the Coban Rondo area, there are many activities that can be done for families, and of course you can get tickets to enter the waterfall, overall, for the price of 745k we got a very pleasant experience staying at the family cabin, Bobo Cabin Coban Rondo.",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"its a whole great experience,  saya datang jam 3.30 sore, suasana berkabut, sepertinya saat itu lokasi penginapan sedang didalam awan, saya datang bersama anak dan suami saya, dengan memesan family cabin dan ditempatkan di pod 3, paling ujung dan lokasinya berangin dibanding 4 family cabin lainnya, namun saya suka karena privasi terjaga, lokasi penginapan ini sangat indah, sangat memesona, saat berkabut suasananya hangat. family cabin ini dapat ditempati oleh 4 orang dewasa + 2 anak, di dalam kamar disediakan 2 kasur yang sama proper (semua seprei dan selimut wangi, kasur memang tidak terlalu empuk namun tidak keras juga), 4 air mineral merk vit botol 600ml, 4 sikat gigi, 4 handuk, 4 teh + gula, 4 cangkir, untuk amenities tidak selengkap hotel dengan harga yang sama, tapi tentu saja, yang dijual oleh bobocabin adalah experience menginap di pegunungan dengan nyaman, suasananya, sangat sangat tenang, sangat cocok untuk refreshing dari keadaan kantor yang beracun 🤣. di lobi hanya ada 1 meja kecil untuk resepsionis yang juga cuma 1 orang, sehingga saat saya datang dan kebetulan ada 4 kamar lain yang juga mau cekin, jadi harus antri cekin nya (mohon maaf saat cekin resepsionis memang kurang ramah, namun saat saya cekout dan posisi sepi, mbak nya ramah dan tersenyum manis sekali, kalau security nya, juara sih, komunikatif dan ramah). sistem kendali di kamar ini adalah smart cabin, lampu, kunci, dan jendela di penginapan ini dapat diatur melalui aplikasi bobobox yang harus di instal untuk tamu yang akan menginap disini, kunci kamar hanya scan dari qr code, jendela di kamar kami sempat mengalami bug, namun dengan chat di aplikasi, petugas penginapan dapat langsung me restart sistem di kamar. kami beruntung datang di suasana berkabut dan hujan gerimis, sehingga mendapatkan view misty, lalu di jam 3.30 pagi saat kabut hilang, pemandangan kota batu sangat memesona kami. indah sekali.  dari penginapan bisa order bbq + peralatan masaknya, but its quite pricey so i only order for breakfast, sebelum cekin saya sudah membawa makan dari warung dibawah, dan cemilan lengkap untuk anak saya, juga buah2han, susu, mie cup, telor rebus (saya googling katanya di penginapan ini enggak ada restonya), jadi saat di penginapan saya tidak kelaparan hehe. di penginapan ini tersedia dapur umum yang didalamnya ada fasilitas cuci piring serta 2 microwave (bisa manasin nasi, pempek dan rawon dari warung dibawah 🎉) ada penjualan minuman ringan juga, lalu ada buku2 yang bisa dibaca secara gratis dan pilihan bukunya waow, tidak banyak namun berkualitas, saya melihat haenim sutmin, murakami, dan paulo coelho di kabinet didalam dapur 🤭. untuk masuk ke kawasan coban rondo, harus membayar 25k per orang dan 10k untuk kendaraan.  jika ada satu hal yang agak mengecewakan, saya rasa itu adalah menu sarapan american breakfast yang dihargai 115k, kuantitasnya sedikit dan yang kami dapatkan berbeda dengan di menu, katanya akan dapat mashed potatoes, namun yang didapatkan adalah potato wedges, lalu saat pagi, sangat banyak lalat di luar kamar yang sampai merangsek masuk ke dalam kamar, sungguh menjengkelkan.  di sekitar hotel, di dalam kawasan coban rondo, ada banyak kegiatan yang bisa dilakukan untuk keluarga, dan tentu saja sudah dapat tiket untuk masuk ke air terjunnya, overall, dengan harga 745k kami mendapatkan pengalaman yang sangat menyenangkan menginap di family cabin, bobocabin coban rondo."
Bella Chandraa,1.0,"got a room that was quite equivalent to a 4-star hotel. but the service was very lacking, especially if you bring small children here, it would be even more complicated. because the service is self-service. and what happened to my little brother, my husband brought a lot of luggage but none of the staff helped him until my little brother fell, they just laughed at him. because this was entering Coban Rondo, so they asked for another ticket per person for 30 thousand. after arriving at the lobby, the luggage was unloaded and the parking lot was not there so there was no valet, so they went back to park the car below with foggy roads and the edge of the cliff. don't bring small children because it would be a hassle with a lot of luggage, because no one helped. then when buying food or snacks they said it wasn't ready. well because I was hungry, I just bought rice for 40 thousand, fiesta rice was listed on the menu for 40 thousand but they charged 140 and didn't give me a bill. the attitude is lacking, and not friendly to customers. the place is quite narrow so if you want to poop or pee, the smell will definitely reach the bed, the good thing is because of the mountain view. but if it rains you can't see it either. I don't think I'll come back again",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"dapat kamar yang harganya cukup setara sama hotel bintang 4. tapi pelayananya sangat kurang banget, apalagi kalau bawa anak kecil kesini malah tambah ribet. karena pelayananya self service. dan kejadian pada adek aku, suamiku bawa bawaan banyak tapi staff nya enggak ada yang batuin sampai adekku jatuh cuma diketawain saja. karena ini masuk ke coban rondo jadi dimintain tiket lagi per orang 30 ribu. setelah nyampek di lobby barang diturunkan dan parkirnya bukan disitu jadi enggak ada valet, jadi balik lagi buat naruh mobil dibawah dengan jalanan kabut dan pinggir jurang. untuk bawa anak kecil jangan ya karena pasti repot barang bawaan yang banyak, soalnya enggak ada yang bantuin. terus saat beli makan atau snack dibilang enggak ready. nah berhubung laper jadi beli nasi saja dengan harga 40 ribu nasi fiesta sudah tertera di menunya dengan harga 40 ribu malah ditarik 140 dan enggak dikasih bill.  atitudenya kurang, dan tidak ramah sama customer. untuk tempatnya cukup sempit ya jadi kalau mau pup atau pipis pasti baunya sampai tempat tidur, bagus nya karena view pegunungan. tapi kalau hujan juga enggak kelihatan. untuk balik lagi sih kayak nya enggak"

(at most only 3 meters) I was with 4 children and 2 using a deluxe room. honestly the bed didn't fit to sleep, plus the mattress was hard (like a thin sponge). no TV! no refrigerator! I booked a price of around 900 thousand😭 just imagine. (compare it yourself with other hotels🤦‍♀️). actually the interior of the room is nice, it's just not big enough!🥺. oh yeah, everything here is self-service. if possible, just bring a few people with you. I definitely won't be staying a second time. 🙏hopefully there will be changes in the future. nb: because I just tried it so I didn't want to book the family room right away because the price at that time was 1.8 million🤦‍♀️. so I want to know first what the regular room is like.

(bandingkan sendiri deh sama hotel lain🤦‍♀️). sebenarnya bagus interior kamarnya cuman kurang besar saja!🥺. oiya disini semua self service ya. kalau bisa bawa bareng dikit2 saja. kayaknya sudah pasti enggak menginap untuk yang kedua kali nya. 🙏semoga kedepannya ada perubahan. nb: berhub karena saya baru mencoba jadi saya enggak mau langsung book yang family karena harganya waktu itu di 1.8jt🤦‍♀️. jadi pengin tau dulu seperti apa kmr nya yang biasa. untunglah enggak book yang fam, bisa makin kecewa😔."
Nur Muafiyah,1.0,"just once 1. the first order does not mean you get a good cabin view (according to the system because the first order so you get cabin 1 who has been there must know cabin 1, 2 has a bad view) after complaining half an hour later we just got confirmation to be moved to cabin 26 which is located at the end, that's enough to say refund, we ordered it a long time ago besides the price that changes every day also the expectation is to get the view 2. ordered a deluxe cabin because the information is enough for 2 adults 2 children <10 you know, eh it turns out it's also cramped 3. self service which we think is inappropriate, just imagine if you get the cabin at the end you have to pick up the order near the lobby. exercise guys, even though you pay for the price of the same type of tourist spot, then the most annoying thing is when it's finished being made there's no chat confirmation that it can be picked up 4. you're in but without ventilation so you can imagine when it's used for poop in the room how it smells like 5.

The female receptionist is very indifferent, not friendly! Suggestion: if possible, find an employee who is professional in their field.

Mathius Yanuarjo,5.0,"the concept is not a hotel, more like a cabin rental in the coban rondo area. the system uses an application, you can't choose a cabin number because it's random from the first application the car arrives in front of the reception to drop off the goods. after that move to the parking lot which is about 1km away. from the parking lot take a komodo car back to the reception. oh yeah the width of the road from the parking lot to the receptionist is just right for 1 car but you won't meet another car because there is security who monitors the reception and parking lot. if you don't meet security in the parking lot, just call them. there is a cellphone number at the parking stop. I'm afraid if you go straight in you might meet a komodo car for service in the self-service cabin, the staff only helps fill out the application. there is a public kitchen for washing dishes and ovens yourself. there is also a drink refrigerator but I don't know where to pay. what I saw was only 2 reception staff & only 2 security people the cabin is a smart cabin, open using a barcode from the application. adjust the glass, door lock, lights can also use the application. I ordered a family cabin, got 4 cups of tea & sugar, 4 towels, 15 liter water heater. It's better to bring your own food because if you order it, it will take a long time",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"konsepnya bukan hotel, lebih ke persewaan kabin di area coban rondo. sistemnya pakai aplikasi, enggak bisa pilih nomor cabin karena random dari aplikasi  pertama datang mobil bisa sampai di depan resepsionis untuk turunkan barang-barang. setelah itu pindah ke parkiran yang jaraknya kurleb 1km. dari parkiran naik mobil komodo balik lagi ke resepsionis. oh iya lebar jalan dari parkiran ke resepsionis pas 1 mobil tapi enggak bakal papasan dengan mobil lain karena ada security yang monitor di resepsionis & parkiran. kalo enggak ketemu security di parkiran langsung telpon saja. ada nomer hp di halte parkiran. takutnya kalo langsung masuk bisa papasan dengan mobil komodo  untuk pelayanan di cabin self service, staff cuma bantu ngisi aplikasi. ada dapur umum untuk cuci piring & oven sendiri. ada kulkas minuman juga tapi enggak tau bayarnya kemana. yang saya lihat staff resepsionis cuma 2 orang & security cuma 2 orang  cabinnya sudah smart cabin, buka pakai barcode dari aplikasi. atur kaca, kunci pintu, lampu bisa pakai aplikasi juga.  saya order family cabin, dapat teh & gula 4 cangkir, handuk 4, water heater 15 liter. mending langsung bawa makanan sendiri karena kalo pesan kayanya lama"

PingAn Chen,4.0,"1. The position is in the coban rondo labyrinth area, waterfall, etc. so when you enter the info gate, you will spend the night in bobocabin and be charged 25k/person and 10k/car. can be used to enter the labyrinth and waterfall. 2. usually when checking in, the car will be directed to enter the hotel area, (max 3 cars in this check-in area), then the car will be returned to the hotel parking lot. then the guest will be picked up using a komodo car (max 3 passengers: 1 in front, 2 behind) to return to the hotel area. the distance between the parking area and the hotel area is about 500m-1km through a narrow paved road next to the ravine. 3. to enter the room, you can use the bobobox application and open the room door via the qr code pas: can only use 1 id per room so if you need an additional key, just send a photo of the qr code to another family's cellphone. 4. ** there are no bellboys or hotel staff to carry luggage to the cabin. you can bring your own luggage to the cabin room via a slightly uphill path.** 5. for the cabins above, some are not finished yet, and do not have wooden decks and are only made of stone. while those below on average already have wooden decks. while other cabins 6. fire communal (bonfire around 35k) but currently not available 7. may bring your own portable stove and food ingredients, but stove rentals and frozen food ingredients are also provided. 8. in the room there is a smart tint pdlc that can be changed from blur to clear (like in bathrooms in Japan). and also a smart lamp that can change color and 2 choices of soothing music that can be accessed via the panel in the room. 9. water heater capacity 15l (2 people) and if it runs out it takes 2 hours to reheat. fitting: it should not run out if used normally, but the size of the bathroom is quite narrow. 10. quiet hours from 9-7 am. and because the morning sunlight can still penetrate the blurred windows, we will likely wake up around 5 am. 11. Sometimes the hotel area will be covered in very thick fog, making it a bit difficult when cooking outdoors. Overall: nice view, inadequate staff, hopefully in the future there will be additional bellboy staff, internet speed is quite adequate (around 5mbps upload and download). or a regular pick-up schedule from the parking area (if there are visitors who want to go out to buy food etc., there are no officers to take them back to the hotel area).",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"1. posisinya masuk di dalam area coban rondo labyrinth , waterfall dll  jadi ketika masuk gerbang info, akan bermalam di bobocabin dan dikenakan biaya 25k/orang dan 10k/mobil. dapat digunakan untuk masuk ke labyrinth dan waterfall.  2. biasanya ketika cek ini mobil akan diarahkan memasuki area hotel, ( max 3 mobil di area cek ini), kemudian mobil diantarkan kembali ke parkir hotel. lalu penginap akan dijemput menggunakan mobil komodo ( max 3 penumpang : 1 didepan, 2 di belakang ) untuk kembali ke area hotel.  jarak antara area parkir dan area hotel sekitar 500m-1km melalui jalan sempit berpaving disebelah jurang.  3. untuk masuk kamar bisa menggunakan aplikasi bobobox dan buka pintu kamar melalui qr code  pas : hanya bisa menggunakan 1 id per kamar  jadi apabila membutuhkan kunci tambahan tinggal mengirimkan foto qr code ke hp keluarga lain.  4. **tidak ada bellboy ataupun staff hotel untuk membawakan barang bawaan ke cabin. anda dapat membawa sendiri barang bawaan menuju ke kamar cabin melalui jalan yang sedikit menanjak.**  5. untuk cabin yang berada di atas beberapa belum jadi, dan tidak memiliki wooden deck dan hanya beralaskan batu. sedangkan yang berada di bawah rata rata sudah memiliki wooden deck. sedangkan cabin lain  6. fire communal ( api unggun sekitar 35k) tetapi saat ini belum tersedia 7. boleh membawa kompor portable dan bahan makanan sendiri, tetapi juga disediakan persewaan kompor dan bahan makanan frozen.  8. didalam kamar terdapat smart tint pdlc yang bisa dirubah dari blur menjadi clear ( seperti di kamar mandi di jepang ). dan juga smart lamp yang dapat berubah warna dan 2 pilihan musik menenangkan yang dapat diakses melalui panel di dalam kamar.  9. water heater kapasitas 15l ( 2 orang ) dan apabila habis membutuhkan waktu 2 jam untuk memanaskan ulang. pas : seharusnya tidak habis apabila digunakan secara normal, tetapi ukuran kamar mandi lumayan sempit.  10. jam tenang jam 9-jam 7 pagi.  dan karena sinar matahari pagi masih bisa menembus jendela yang di blur, kemungkinan kita akan terbangun sekitar jam 5 pagi.  11. terkadang di area hotel akan tertutup kabut yang sangat tebal, sehingga akan agak menyulitkan ketika hendak memasak di luar ruangan.  overall : pemandangan bagus, staff kurang memadai, semoga dikemudian hari ada tambahan staff bellboy kecepatan internet cukup memadai ( sekitar 5mbps upload dan download ).  ataupun jadwal rutin penjemputan dari area parkir ( apabila ada pengunjung yang hendak keluar membeli makanan dsb, tidak ada petugas yang mengantar kembali ke area hotel )."

I got cabin 2 (not the best view) when I entered the room I was really surprised because the towels were below, the mattress hadn't been cleaned. I went straight to the lobby & (quite) angry because how come with that price I checked in this afternoon and the room was like that. There I asked to change rooms, +- 10 minutes I got cabin 1 (not the best view). The impressions: 1. Dirty glass, the roof glass was also dirty 2. The room was musty 3. The toilet had no ventilation 4. Hard mattress (but it's okay if I'm comfortable enough) 5. It turns out that now (maybe) private cars are only allowed to go as far as the parking lot, while I went straight to the lobby because there was no notification except for the sign ""4 wheels stop"" at the initial entrance to bobocabin. Well, I've already reached the lobby and just been told by the security guard that I like the most about Bobo Cabin Coban Rondo: 1. The security guard is super friendly and helpful 2. The atmosphere and view are really good 3. When I went out, the security guard offered me a jeep ride which my kids liked & of course he was assisted by a really nice and friendly security guard 4.

Hy Ua,3.0,"to be honest, the plus point of this place is just the location. in the mountains, cool, in the morning the view is good. it's really the effect of selling the experience, now I list the minuses: 1. the most important, the road from the parking lot to the reception location is very narrow if the car is not a small car. there is a shuttle facility but only until 6pm. so if it's over that hour you can't go to the city anymore. if you want to go to the car, be escorted by the security guard, use a motorcycle 2. don't come here during the rainy season, you won't be able to have a bbq and bonfire. if you don't bring food, you have to order food here. btw, the food here is also ordered from nearby stalls. so expect slow delivery and average quality 3. Bed sheets and pillowcases are not replaced. there is still dirt (hair, food crumbs, etc) on the mattress 4. the bathroom has no ventilation and is quite narrow. For people with big bodies, overalls are a bit difficult, I think it's enough to go here once. the pluses are not comparable to the minuses. The price is almost the same, just go to Aston or Amartha Hills",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"jujur saja, plusnya tempat ini cuma lokasinya. di gunung, adem, kalau pagi bagus pemandangannya. memang kesannya jual experience saja sih  sekarang gue list minusnya: 1. yang paling utama, jalan dari parkiran ke lokasi resepsionisnya sempit banget kalau mobilnya bukan mobil kecil. ada fasilitas shuttle tapi cuma sampai jam6 sore. jadi kalau di atas jam itu sudah enggak bisa ke kota lagi. kalau mau ke mobil entar diantar satpam pakai motor 2. jangan kesini pas musim hujan, enggak akan bisa bbq dan api unggun. kalau pas enggak bawa makan, harus pesan makanan disini. btw makanan disini ini pesannya juga di warung2 dekat situ. jadi expect slow delivery and average quality 3. sprei dan sarung bantal kayak enggak diganti. masih ada kotoran (rambut, remah makanan, etc) di kasur 4. kamar mandi enggak ada ventilasi dan agak sempit. buat orang yang badannya gede agak susah  overall sih menurutku cukup sekali saja kesini. plusnya enggak sebanding dengan minusnya. harga hampir sama, mending ke aston atau amartha hills saja"

aa,5.0,good view and nice experience with the nature,a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,good view and nice experience with the nature
Mena Setyaji,1.0,"since the grand opening promo, I immediately booked. I got the promo price via the application which turned out to be cheaper than the price in online hotel bookings. Then I waited for a month, I was happy to heal in a cabin with a view, but when I arrived at the place I got a cabin with no view. Here are some unpleasant experiences that I had about Bobo Cabin Coban Rondo: 1. The receptionist, the short-haired lady, was not very friendly. She seemed lazy to receive guests. I have stayed at several inns for several times, but this time there was no friendly welcome. Moreover, when I complained and asked to change rooms, I was only answered ""I can't change rooms, ma'am, so there really is no solution"". 2. The cabins are random by the system so I can't request a room, let alone ask for an exchange. What's even worse is that I got a cabin without a view. So for those of you who plan to stay here, don't have high expectations because you saw social media. At that time I also had time to watch their IG live. The staff gave me information that all cabins have a view, but in reality they don't. I swear I was really annoyed when I got there. The price was sold for a view but I didn't get the view. deluxe type without view is 1,2,4,6 and 8. It's just unlucky if you get one of those cabins, the best among the cabins without view is cabin 1 because it still has a view of the pine forest and not when people are passing by so it's still nice if you want to relax while enjoying the smart window. The safest type is the family type because the cabin has a view of the entire slope. 3. When I was complaining to the receptionist and was annoyed, I was interrupted by a skinny young security guard who was moving the car to the parking lot. I just scolded him back. When someone is annoyed, they don't calm him down but interrupt him. 4. There is no ventilation in the toilet so if the toilet is opened, the whole cabin will automatically smell. 5. The sheets and blankets smell musty like cheap laundry. 6. The wifi is fast but unstable. Often disconnected especially at night. 7. The complimentary only gets 2 bottles of mineral water without sugar, tea or coffee. And of course, the price of the cabin doesn't include breakfast. 8. When checking in, they helped me carry my luggage but only once, the rest was carried by the guest themselves. When checking out, no one helped me carry my luggage at all. My first experience trying bobocabin was an unpleasant experience. I only did it once and I don't want to go there again 😤",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"dari sejak promo grand opening langsung booking. dapat hrg promonya via aplikasi yang ternyata tetap lebih murah harganya di online booking hotel. terus deh ditunggu2 sebulanan, berangkat senang mau healing di cabin with view eh sampai tempat dapat cabin yang no view. berikut ini beberapa pengalaman yang tidak menyenangkan yang saya rasakan tentang bobocabin coban rondo :  1. resepsionis mbak-mbak yang rambutnya pendek kurang ramah. kayak males2an terima tamu. beberapa kali nginep di penginapan baru kali ini enggak ada sambutan yang ramah. apalagi pas lagi komplain meminta tukar kamar, cuma dijawab “enggak bisa tukar kamar bu jadi memang enggak ada solusi”.  2. cabinnya random by sistem jadi enggak bisa request room apalagi meminta tuker. apesnya lagi pas itu saya dapat cabin tanpa view. jadi buat kalian yang mau rencana nginep disini jangan berekspektasi tinggi gara-gara lihat sosmed ya. waktu itu saya juga sempat menonton ig live nya. stafnya kasih info katanya semua cabin dapat view, tapi kenyataannya enggak dong. sumpah kesel banget pas sampai sana. harga segitu yang dijual view tapi enggak dapat viewnya. tipe deluxe yang enggak dapat view itu 1,2,4,6 dan 8. cuma apes2nya kalo dapat diantara cabin tersebut, yang paling mending diantara cabin no view itu ya cabin 1 karena masih dapat view hutan pinus dan enggak pas orang-orang lewat jadi masih enak kalo pengin nyantai sambil menikmati smart windownya. paling aman tipe family karena cabinnya dapat view lereng semua.  3. pas lagi ngomel2 ke resepsionis dan kesel eh disela dong sama satpam yang badannya kurus masih muda untuk pindahin mobil ke parkiran. balik saya omelin saja. orang lagi kesel enggak ditenangin malah disela.  4. enggak ada ventilasi di toiletnya jadi kalo toilet dibuka otomatis bau deh seisi cabin.  5. sprei dan selimut baunya apek kayak laundryan murah.  6. wifi cepat tapi enggak stabil. sering putus2 apalagi di malam hari.  7. complimentarynya cuma dapat 2 botol air mineral saja tanpa ada gula, teh atau kopi. dan tentunya harga cabin segitu enggak dapat breakfast.  8. pas check ini dibantuin bawa barang tapi cuma sekali bawa, sisanya dibawa tamunya sendiri. waktu check out sama sekali enggak ada yang bantuin bawa barang.  pengalaman pertama mencoba bobocabin langsung dapat hal yang tidak menyenangkan. cukup sekali dan enggak mau kesana lagi 😤"
Fery Dwi Arizal,3.0,"the place is nice, the room is nice, the atmosphere is very nice, but maybe the entrance road could be widened a little, especially for large vehicles on the small bridge, or maybe a shuttle could be provided. and maybe the price for staying overnight would be more exciting if it was included with the entrance ticket.",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,tempatnya bagus kamarnya bagus suasanyanya sangat bagus sekali  cuma mungkin buat jalan masuk mungkin bisa di lebarkan sedikit apalagi kalau kendaraan besar di jembatan kecil itu atau mungkin di siapkan shuttle.  dan mungkin buat harga buat menginap lebih seru kalau sudah include dengan tiket masuk.

Victor Santoso,2.0,"the parking lot is not yet ready, hopefully it will be ready in the future, parking near the Coban Rondo rides, back and forth accompanied by security guards and employees, several times there were still inserts because the lane was only for 1 car when I came to check this at around 14 o'clock the room was not ready, there was the leftover food on the terrace was surrounded by hornets, until the afternoon 3 of the hornets didn't go around and surrounded us, we asked for help to chase them away, they took a long time to come, with the addition of the statement, all the rooms had hornets, we surveyed them all and there weren't any.  bbq is expensive, not complete, and take it yourself. In other rooms it turns out some people also bring their own stoves and cooking utensils. no one checked the cabin area, I couldn't imagine getting my own end room.  The room interior is okay, the Bluetooth speaker is ordinary, the audio quality is low and difficult to connect. The windows are not clean, the mosquito screen design cannot close completely because of the window handle. when we stay in the rain all day, hope there will be an additional canopy / large umbrella for the balcony, if not then you won't be able to leave the room without getting wet. The saddest thing (for me, let others judge for themselves) is, when it rains and the roof of the cottage made of metal, there is no dampening between the metal and the wood of the interior covering. So I was awake almost all night because of the loud sound of rain hitting the metal roof.  So in my opinion, with the price of the room compared to the service and facilities I got, I didn't get the value that met my expectations (and I still got the early blue price which wasn't full)",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"tempat parkir belum jadi, semoga ke depan sudah jadi, parkir di dekat wahana coban rondo, bolak balik diantar satpam dan pegawainya, beberapa kali masih terjadi sisipan karena jalur cuma untuk 1 mobil  waktu saya datang untuk check ini kurleb pukul 14 kamar belum siap, ada sisa makanan di teras dikerumuni hornet, sampai sore hornetnya 3 ekor enggak pergi2 mengerumuni kami, diminta bantuan untuk mengusir lama banget datengnya, dengan ditambahi keterangan, semua kamar ada hornetnya, kita sudah survey semua dan tidak ada.  bbq mahal, tidak lengkap, dan ambil sendiri. kamar lain ternyata juga ada yang bawa sendiri juga kompor dan alat masak. tidak ada yang cek ricek area cabin2, enggak bisa bayangkan dapat kamar ujung sendiri.  kamar interior oke, bluetooth speaker rakitan biasa, kualitas audio rendah dan susah connect. kaca2 kurang bersih, desain kasa nyamuk tidak bisa menutup sempurna karena handle jendela. pas kita nginep hujan sepanjang hari, berharap akan ada penambahan kanopi / payung besar untuk di balkon, kalo enggak ya enggak akan bisa keluar kamar tanpa basah  yang paling sedih (bagi saya ya, silakan yang lain menilai sendiri) adalah, ketika hujan dan atap cottage terbuat dari logam, tidak ada peredam antara logam dan kayu penutup interiornya. jadi saya terjaga hampir sepanjang malam karena suara hujan yang cukup keras kena atap logam.  jadi menurut saya dengan harga kamar dibandingkan dengan pelayanan dan fasilitas yang didapat saya belum mendapatkan value yang sesuai dengan harapan saya (dan ini saya masih dapat early biru price yang tidak full)"

Dave kos,3.0,"Compared to other bobocabins on the island of Java, this one has the best view. Only if you get cabin number 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, that means you're unlucky. Yesterday I went there again and it was bad for the same price but I got a cabin in the middle, not on the slope. There are so many people passing by, so like it or not, the windows are always blurred. I went all the way there to enjoy the view on the slopes but it turned out to be zoned out. It's better if the price is differentiated for the cabin position on the slope and the one in the middle so that customers don't regret that they expected to get a view of the slope but it turns out to be zonk. but yes, it is a little relieved by the view at night and the sunrise, even though you have to be cold looking from outside because you can't see it from inside the room. The security personnel should be appreciated because they were the ones who took us from the lobby to the parking lot and vice versa. use a private motorbike too. So at least give them tips. In the morning the sound of the mockingjay bird is really good. Overall, the best thing was just the sincerity of the security who was willing to take us back and forth",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"dibanding bobocabin yang lain di pulau jawa, ini paling oke sih view nya. cuma kalo lu dapat cabin no 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 itu berarti lu lagi apes. kemarin kesana lagi apes saja dengan harga sama tapi dapat cabin yang posisi nya di tengah, bukan di lereng. sudah begitu dilewatin orang-orang pula jadi mau enggak mau jendela selalu di blur. jauh2 kesana mau menikmati view di lereng tapi ternyata zonk. mending harga nya dibedain untuk posisi cabin yang di lereng dan yang di tengah biar customer enggak menyesal sudah expect dapat view lereng ternyata zonk. tapi ya sedikit terobati dengan view malam hari n sunrise nya walopun harus kedinginan lihat dari luar karena enggak bisa lihat dari dalam kamar. security2 nya patut di apresiasi karena mereka-mereka yang anter kita dari lobby ke parkiran dan sebaliknya. pakai motor pribadi pula. jadi minimal kasih tips lah buat mereka. kalo pagi juga suara burung mockingjay nya bagus banget. overall yang paling oke cuma keikhlasan security nya yang rela nganter kita bolak balik"
Gisela Elshadelin,1.0,"good things: cool air and friendly security guards, willing to take guests by motorbike because the distance between the parking lot and the hotel is quite far bad things: 1. random and unfair room selection. I ordered a deluxe room, and was placed in the middle where many people passed by (I will upload the picture). honestly, I didn't ask for it to be on a slope, but with the position in the middle there is no privacy, because if the window is opened, other people can see us. and finally I had to close the window because it was uncomfortable if people saw us (in my opinion there is no privacy provided by the hotel) 2. staff who lack communication. I wanted to order food, but the staff suddenly said that the order was closed, even though there was no written information. even on the menu it says ""orders can be made through the host at 07.00-21.00"", and I ordered at 18.30. how can guests know the closing time if they are not informed verbally or in writing? 😅 3. very hard mattress. is it possible that because the concept is in the middle of the forest it is hard? 4. There is no staff to help you carry your stuff up to the cabin. So, if you have a lot of stuff, it will be tiring. In my opinion, the price and service are very inappropriate. A bit disappointed. The room rate is 650 for deluxe. So, I'm quite disappointed, and I won't be back. My advice for those who want to come here is to choose a family room because it's definitely on a slope.",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"hal yang bagus: udara sejuk dan satpam juga ramah, bersedia mengantar tamu dengan sepeda motor karena jarak parkiran dan hotel yang cukup jauh  hal buruk: 1. pemilihan kamar secara random dan tidak adil. saya pesan kamar deluxe, dan ditaruh di tengah yang dimana banyak orang yang lewat (akan saya upload gambarnya). jujur, saya tidak meminta untuk di lereng, namun dengan posisi di tengah itu tidak ada privasi, karena jika jendela di buka, orang lain bisa melihat kita. dan akhirnya saya harus menutup jendela karena risih juga kalau dilihat orang (menurut saya lebih tidak ada privasi yang diberikan oleh pihak hotel)  2. staff yang kurang komunikasi. saya ingin order makanan, namun staff tiba-tiba bilang kalau sudah close order, padahal tidak ada info secara tertulis. bahkan di menu tertulis “pemesanan bisa dilakukan melalui host pukul 07.00-21.00”, dan saya pesan pukul 18.30. bagaimana tamu bisa tau jam close order kalau tidak diinfo secara lisan atau tulisan? 😅  3. kasur yang keras sekali. apa mungkin karena konsepnya di tengah hutan jadi keras?  4. tidak ada staff yang akan membantu barang kalian untuk naik ke cabin. jadi, kalau barangnya banyak akan capek.  menurut saya harga dan pelayanan sangat tidak sesuai. agak kecewa. rate roomnya 650 untuk deluxe. jadi, cukup kecewa ya, dan tidak akan kembali.  saran saya bagi yang mau kesini lebih baik pilih family room karena pasti di lereng."
Alexander Himawan,2.0,"I got a promo price of 580k for Duluxe room. Very good place, cool foggy atmosphere, super cool. The view of Batu city in the morning & evening is very spectacular 🤝 Disclaimer: I'm not a picky person when it comes to hotels and lodgings, I was a bit surprised, even though the price was quite good but the service was not according to the price. Some of my disappointments: 1. Can't choose a room, we got a cabin in front of the road where people pass by, not the ones on ig, tiktok influencers. We checked this at 1 am or 2 am. There were only 3 new guests including my car, logically I could choose a place, the price is the same as the one with a cliff view. Can't choose a room because it's random by the system 🤝 Maybe, the system just logs in to the admin, changes the room are done. Strange reason. 2. It was raining in the afternoon until 6 pm, I wanted to order bbq, the rain stopped at 6.30 I ordered, but it turned out I couldn't with the excuse that the order closes at 6.15 which is not written rule for closing bbq orders at 6.15, after arguing for a while I finally said ""please help"", finally I was allowed to order, fortunately I was allowed, if I wasn't allowed to order I wouldn't have eaten, even though I brought my own meat to grill 🤝 3. Entering the bobocabin lobby area via a small road, only enough for 1 car, when I went there there was no staff at all to greet me at the entrance area. fortunately there were no cars from the opposite direction at that time. well respect for the security guards there, they escorted customers from the lobby to the car parking lot by motorbike and their own gasoline. I gave them tips because they helped 🤝 4. The CS and staff were not in sync, some of their words didn't match, so there were several things that were miscommunicated. maybe it wasn't briefed by the management. conclusion, is it worth coming to 2x? no. 1x is enough if you have never been here, I admit that for city people, the atmosphere here is very healing. as long as the quality of service has not been improved, coming to 2x is not recommended 🙏 for the same price of 750 normal price, I prefer Amerta Hills for the next one. the 1.5jt family cabin, can get 1 golden tulip room 🤝 I give 2 stars because to appreciate the security guard and the cool air 🤝",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"saya dapat hrga promo 580k untuk duluxe room. very good place, suasana dingin berkabut mantap, super sejuk. view kota batu pagi & malam sangat spektakuler 🤝  disklaimer : saya bukan orang yang picky dalam hal hotel dan penginapan, saya agak kaget saja, padahal hrgnya lumayan tapi servis kurang sesuai harga.  beberapa point kekecewaan saya :  1. tidak bisa plih room, kami dapat cabin di depan jalan orang lewat, bukan yang seperti di ig, tiktok para influencer. kami cek ini jam 1 jam 2an. tamu baru ada 3 mobil include mobil saya, logika saya bisa dong plih tempat, kan harganya sama dengan yang view tebing. tidak bisa plih room karena random by sistem 🤝 yakali, sistem tinggal login admin, ganti room selesai. alesan yang aneh.  2. keadaan sore hujan sampai jam 6an sore, saya mau psen bbq, keadaan selesai hujan jam 6.30 saya psen, ternyta tidak bisa dengan alesan close order 6.15 yang mana tidak ada aturan tertulis close order bbq 6.15, setelah berdebat sbtr akhirnya saya bilang ""tolong di bantu"", akhirnya boleh pesan, untung boleh, kalo enggak boleh psen enggak jadi makan, padahal deh bawa daging sendiri untuk di bakar 🤝  3. masuk ke area lobi bobocabin lewat jalan kecil hanya cukup 1 mobil, waktu saya kesana tidak ada staff sama sekali yang menyambut di area pintu masuk. untung tidak ada mobil dari lwn arah waktu itu. well respect untuk para satpam disana, mereka antarkan customer dari lobi ke parkiran mbl naik motor sendiri dan bensin sendiri. saya kasih tips lah karena membantu 🤝  4. antara cs dan staff enggak sinkron, omongnnya ada yang enggak match, jadi ada beberapa hal yang miskom. mungkin kurang di brief oleh manajemennya.  kesimuplan, apakah worth untuk datang ke 2x ? no. cukup 1x kalo kamu belum pernah kesini, saya akuin memang untuk orang kota, suasan disini sangat healing. selama kualitas service belum di tingkatkan, datang ke 2x tidak dianjurkan 🙏 untuk harga yang sama 750 normal price, saya lebih plih amerta hills untuk nextnya. yang 1.5jt family cabin, bisa dapat 1 kamar golden tulip 🤝  saya kasih bintang 2 karena untuk mengapresiasi satpam dan udara yang sejuk 🤝"

Vilanda Mauliya,4.0,"really exciting experience staying at bobocabin 🥳 got a cabin with a direct view of the forest and the city. the atmosphere is perfect for relaxing and very beautiful. the morning is greeted with the sound of birds ✨ from all the advantages there are some suggestions for bobocabin coban rondo, first, when I stayed there was a problem with the water being blocked around 21.00 to 10.00. the suggestion is, an emergency bathroom can be added specifically for the tub and poop, not for bathing 👍 second, at 21.00 there is an announcement from the center that 9 o'clock is quiet time. the next suggestion if there are problems at the inn, either power outages, water being blocked, etc., can also be informed from the center through the existing speaker. to provide a sense of calm and anticipation for tourists 😊 third, related to cabin cleanliness. hopefully over time the cleaning of bobocabin will get better and improve 👍 besides that there is a suggestion to provide information on any facilities provided by bobocabin. such as ovens, cold drinks, etc. 😊 thank you very much bobocabin coban rondo. Hopefully it will improve in the future 👍👍",a year,Bobocabin Coban Rondo Malang,"seru banget pengalaman menginap di bobocabin 🥳 dapat cabin yang view nya langsung ke hutan dan kota. suasananya sangat pas untuk relax dan sangat asri. pagi hari disambut dengan suara burung2 ✨ dari semua kelebihan itu ada beberapa saran untuk bobocabin coban rondo, pertama, saat saya menginap ada kendala air macet sekitar jam 21.00 sampai 10.00. sarannya, bisa ditambahkan kamar mandi darurat khusus untuk bak dan bab, tidak untuk mandi 👍 kedua, saat jam 21.00 ada pengumuman dari pusat bahwa jam 9 adalah jam tenang. saran selanjutnya apabila ada kendala di penginapan baik listrik mati, air macet dsb bisa dinfokan juga dari pusat melalui speaker yang ada. agar memberi rasa tenang dan antisipasi bagi para wisatawan 😊 ketiga, terkait kebersihan cabin. semoga seiring berjalannya waktu pembersihan bobocabin semakin baik dan meningkat 👍 selain itu ada saran untuk memberi keterangan terhadap apapun fasilitas yang diberi bobocabin. seperti oven, minuman dingin dsb 😊  terimakasih banyak bobocabin coban rondo. semoga semakin meningkat kedepannya 👍👍"

inneke theresia,2.0,"went there with family total 4 rooms. the rooms are nice, aesthetic, the view and the hotel environment are good, it's just that there are some things that are very unfortunate. 1. the location is very far from Dieng tourism, +- 1-1.5 hours. fortunately I booked on the last day after Dieng. the road is steep and extreme, returning from the hotel we used the services of a motorbike escort who happened to offer help. help block vehicles from the opposite direction when on sharp bends. 2. arrived at the hotel to check in around 6 pm, arranged rooms that were far apart, could not be close together even though I had booked 4 rooms at once. 3. the check-in process was quite long and complicated because I had to download the app first, and there was only 1 staff. the staff who handled it at that time was not friendly, seemed like a robot. asked what breakfast was, he said it depended on what the kitchen was cooking, my mother is a vegetarian and wanted to request without meat but couldn't. regret choosing a room rate that included breakfast. after I pressed the staff finally answered, usually the menu is fried rice. just answer like that is very difficult 😰 breakfast time is also only available at 8 am, so for guests who plan to leave the room early can't 😌. breakfast is sent to the room 2 boxes of fried rice and 2 cups of sweet tea. for the price charged like the price of a breakfast buffet, so it's not worth it. 4. at night it was drizzling, my room was not provided with an umbrella, while in the room across there was an umbrella. I called the hotline which said it was 24 hours, until I checked out the umbrella did not come. 😂 5. hot water is limited to 20 liters, or for 2 people to take a shower, it said, just taking a shower for 1 person, hot water is no longer available. the other room has not been used, the hot water is no longer available. reported the hotline no response, until I called, finally met the field staff and immediately reported to the technician. please fix it in the future, if I am told to come back here again I will think again 🤣",6 days,Bobocabin Dieng Wonosobo,"ke sana bersama keluarga total 4 kamar. kamarnya bagus, estetik, pemandangan dan suasana lingkungan hotel bagus, hanya saja ada beberapa hal yang sangat disayangkan.  1. lokasinya sangat amat jauh dari wisata dieng, +-1-1,5 jam. untung saya booking di hari terakhir setelah dari dieng. jalannya curam dan ekstrim, pulang dari hotel kami menggunakan jasa pengawal motor yang kebetulan menawarkan bantuan. bantu menghalau kendaraan dari arah berlawanan saat di tikungan2 tajam. 2. tiba di hotel untuk check ini sekitar jam 6 malam, diaturkan kamar yang berjauhan, tidak bisa berdekatan padahal sudah booking 4 kamar sekaligus. 3. proses check ini cukup lama dan ribet karena harus download app dulu, dan staff cuma 1. staff yang handle saat itu tidak ramah, terkesan seperti robot. ditanya breakfastnya apa, katanya tergantung kitchen nya masak apa, ibu saya vegetarian mau request tanpa daging2an tidak bisa. menyesal pilih rate kamar yang termasuk breakfast. setelah saya desak baru staff nya menjawab, biasanya menunya nasi goreng. tinggal jawab begitu saja susah sekali 😰 jam breakfast juga hanya bisa jam 8 pagi, jadi untuk tamu yang berencana keluar kamar lebih pagi tidak bisa 😌. breakfast dikirim ke kamar 2 kotak nasi goreng dan 2 cup teh manis. untuk harga yang di charge seperti harga breakfast buffet, jadi tidak worth. 4. malam hari gerimis, kamar saya tidak disediakan payung, sedangkan di kamar sebrang ada payung. saya hubungi hotline yang katanya 24 jam, sampai saya check out payungnya tidak datang. 😂 5. air panas dibatasi 20 liter, atau untuk 2 orang mandi tulisnya, baru mandi 1 orang air panas sudah tidak bisa. kamar satunya malah belum digunakan sudah tidak bisa air panas nya. lapor hotline tidak respon2, sampai saya telp2, akhirnya ketemu staff lapangan baru langsung dilaporkan ke teknisi.  mohon diperbaiki kedepannya, kalau disuruh kembali lagi ke sini saya pikir2 lagi 🤣"

Ratu Chaira Vielananda,3.0,"My first experience staying at bobocabin was quite disappointing. 1. Access to the location from the direction of Dieng is via the Kayangan toll road which has quite extreme access. Luckily I stayed here on my last day in Dieng, because if I wanted to go back and forth to the famous tourist attractions in Dieng, from this place I can say it is quite far. 2. When I arrived at the place, the parking lot was full and no one was directing the parking, very confusing. 3. Breakfast, this was the most annoying. Previously, it was informed that breakfast was ready at 8. Incidentally, from my cabin the view of the restaurant was visible, breakfast arrived at almost 9. Because the restaurant was starting to get crowded, I decided to go down later. Before deciding, I chatted with the host and it was true that he said the restaurant closes at 10. I arrived at the restaurant around 9.20, there was fried rice (which looked like it was left over) and 3 pieces of omelet served buffet style. I immediately took the fried rice and a piece of egg, it was really small in size. I wanted to take two but didn't have the heart because behind me there were still 3 people queuing. after that I asked the employee and boom he said it was no longer refilled, because it was finished. the condition was half past 9 it hadn't been. the couple behind me was only the wife who got eggs, her husband didn't 😅. then I got up to get tea and boom it turned out it was finished and it wasn't refilled either. put aside the taste of the fried rice which was not delicious, in my opinion, if the promise was that the restaurant would close at 10, the food should still be available. gosh. I was not in the mood 😅 where the place is really far from where, so there is no other choice if breakfast runs out, it's chaotic even though it's not 10 yet 😅 the point is, in terms of the cabin I have no problem at all. comfortable. but think again about staying at any bobocabin again. for those of you who go to Dieng for a calm atmosphere and don't intend to go anywhere this place is suitable. however, for those of you who come here to travel around Dieng, there are still many cheaper, better, and closer accommodations to tourist attractions around Dieng. thank you",a month,Bobocabin Dieng Wonosobo,"pengalaman pertama saya menginap di bobocabin yang cukup mengecewakan.  1. akses ke lokasi dari arah dieng melewati tol kayangan yang aksesnya lumayan ekstrem ya. beruntung saya nginep disini di hari terakhir saya di dieng, karena kalau mau bulak balik tempat wisata yang terkenal di dieng, dari tempat ini bisa saya bilang cukup jauh.  2. pas sampai tempat kondisi tempat parkir penuh dan tidak ada yang mengarahkan parkir, sangat membingungkan.  3. sarapan, ini paling bikin dongkol. sebelumnya diinformasikan sarapan ready jam 8. kebetulan dari cabin saya pemandangan ke resto terlihat, hampir set 9 sarapan baru datang. karena kondisi resto sudah mulai ramai jadi saya memutuskan untuk turun nanti. sebelum memutuskan saya chat dulu host nya dan benar katanya resto close jam 10.  saya sampai resto sekitar 9.20, terlihat ada nasi goreng (yang terlihat sudah sisaan) dan 3 potongan telur dadar yang disajikan prasmanan. saya langsung ambil nasi gorengnya dan sepotong telur, benar-benar kecil ukurannya. mau ambil dua tidak sampai hati karena di belakang saya masih ada 3 orang yang antri. setelah itu saya tanya karyawannya dan boom katanya sudah enggak di refill, karena sudah habis. kondisi jam setengah 9 saja belum. pasangan di belakang saya hanya istrinya saja yang kebagian telur, suaminya enggak 😅. kemudian saya beranjak untuk ambil teh dan boom ternyata habis dan enggak di refill juga. kesampingkan rasa nasi goreng yang enggak ada enak2nya, menurut saya, kalau janjinya jam 10 resto close, makanan juga harusnya masih tersedia. ampun. sudah enggak mood 😅  mana tempatnya benar-benar jauh darimana, jadi enggak ada pilihan lain kalau kehabisan sarapan, kacau padahal belum set 10 😅  intinya, kalau dari segi cabin saya enggak ada masalah sama sekali. nyaman. tapi mikir lagi untuk kembali nginep di bobocabin manapun.  untuk anda yang ke dieng untuk suasana yang tenang dan enggak berniat kemana2 tempat ini cocok.  namun, untuk anda yang kesini untuk berwisata ke sekitar dieng, masih banyak penginapan yang lebih murah, bagus, dan dekat dengan lokasi wisata di sekitar dieng.  terima kasih"

Dinda Amalia,3.0,"the place is really good, fresh, not too far. - but in my opinion the minus is the service. they said if there is anything, if you want to order food you can chat directly via the app. it also says 24 hours. but up to 2 hours no reply. finally we went down to the lobby to order food even though it was really far - the breakfast is also lacking for that price - the air conditioner died in the morning. already chatted until they came they said to wait for the technician. but until check out the air conditioner was not fixed 🙂 - in my opinion the food is also expensive. not comparable to the price please improve the service again",2 months,Bobocabin Dieng Wonosobo,"tempatnya sudah oke banget bagus, segar, enggak terlalu jauh. - tapi menurutku yang minus di pelayanan. katanya kalo ada apa-apa, mau pesan makan bisa langsung chat via apk. tulisannya juga 24 jam. tapi sampai 2 jam enggak dibales. akhirnya kita turun ke lobby buat pesan makan padahal jauh banget - sarapannya juga kurang buat harga segitu - ac pagi2 mati. sudah chat sampai nyamperin katanya disuruh menunggu teknisinya. tapi sampai check out pun enggak dibenerin itu ac🙂 - makanannya menurutku juga mahal. enggak sebanding sama harganya  tolong ditingkatin lagi pelayananya"

Wynona Raissa,3.0,"positive: 1. nice view and photo spots. very beautiful location. access to the location is also clear. the road is also okay. I recommend. 3. all cabins are clean, including the toilet. not dusty and not smelly. amenities are also sufficient. 4. good hospitality, friendly staff, and all good. 5. there is a shuttle and staff who are ready to help with the mobility of visitors and goods/luggage. handling is also fast and the driver is friendly. this is very helpful. negative: 1. breakfast at 8 am is too late, it should be from 7 am. breakfast also came late at 8.20, even though many people were waiting in the communal area. 2. ordering food can only be done via chat, where the admin will collect orders manually and then input them into the kitchen. I ordered dinner but the admin only replied 45 minutes after I first chatted, not to mention having to discuss with the admin which menus are available (many menus are out of stock) and waiting for the food to be cooked for about an hour. in my opinion this process is inefficient and has the potential for miscommunication (under/overorders). My input is to reduce the manual input system, the system is made so that visitors can see whether the menu is available or not, and visitors can order directly to the kitchen. the food is also cold when delivered. please improve the service. 3. umbrellas should be the default amenities in each cabin. umbrellas are important because the location often drizzles. conclusion: with higher prices during the high-season of Eid, bobocabin should be able to provide better service. the surge in visitors and f&b orders should be anticipated. I am happy with the location of the cabin, but disappointed with the service. please improve.",2 months,Bobocabin Dieng Wonosobo,"positif: 1. pemandangan dan spot foto bagus. lokasi sangat indah. akses ke lokasi juga jelas. jalanannya juga oke. saya recommend. 3. cabin bersih semua, termasuk toilet. tidak berdebu dan tidak bau. amenities juga cukup. 4. hospitality bagus, pegawai ramah, dan baik semua. 5. ada shuttle dan pegawai yang siap membantu mobilitas pengunjung dan barang/koper. penanganan juga cepat dan supirnya ramah. ini sangat membantu.  negatif: 1. sarapan jam 8 pagi terlalu siang, harusnya dari jam 7 pagi. sarapan juga datang telat jam 8.20, padahal banyak orang sudah menunggu di area komunal. 2. pesan makanan hanya bisa dilakukan lewat chat, dimana admin akan mengumpulkan order secara manual lalu diinput ke dapur. saya pesan makan malam tapi baru dibalas admin 45 menit setelah saya pertama chat, belum lagi harus diskusi dengan admin menu mana yang available (banyak menu yang sudah habis) dan menunggu makanan dimasak selama kurang lebih satu jam. menurut saya proses ini tidak efisien dan berpotensi untuk miscommunication (order kurang/berlebih). masukan saya agar dikurangi sistem input manual, sistem dibuat agar pengunjung bisa melihat apakah menu available atau tidak, dan pengunjung bisa langsung memesan ke kitchen. makanan juga sudah dingin ketika diantar. mohon diperbaiki servicenya. 3. sebaiknya payung sudah jadi default amenities di setiap kabin. payung penting karena lokasi sering hujan gerimis.  kesimpulan:  dengan harga yang lebih tinggi di saat high-season lebaran, seharusnya bobocabin bisa memberi layanan yang lebih baik. lonjakan pengunjung dan order fnb seharusnya bisa diantisipasi. saya senang dengan lokasi cabin, tapi kecewa dengan service-nya. mohon diperbaiki."

I didn't take a photo of this but the sink faucet came off and rubbed, the faucet in the shower also came off. basically not recommended at all.",a month,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,"cepat saja ya, untuk harga 1,4jt sangat mengecewakan. sangat tidak di maintain dan kotor. jamuran dimana2 (lihat foto) dan kurang bersih. mungkin saja bagus pas baru tapi sekarang sudah enggak bagus. mendingan di grand aston puncak dengan harga 1,2jt dapat full kamar, full kamar mandi luas, kolam renang, dan baru bersih. makanan juga enggak enak enggak bisa habis. ada kawat nyamuk tapi rusak dan bolong jadi apa fungsi nya? saya enggak foto ini tapi sink faucet copot menggok2, keran di shower juga copot. pokoknya enggak recommended sama sekali."

VC,2.0,"location in the natural mountain mas, so the air is fresh. because it often drizzles, the air becomes cold and often foggy. the parking location and the place to stay are opposite, so it's a bit troublesome if you bring more than minimal items. so you have to drop off at the lobby. the place to stay is also not very good access, the turn is not very visible, and it's a bit high and rocky. be careful if the car gets hit underneath. I saw a car hit underneath. it's better to turn back first before going up to the place to stay. minimalist lobby. to stay at bobocabin, we have to download the application. because check in, access to the room door, room service, and even to control the room window use the bobocabin application. very disappointed we got a room randomly, couldn't choose a room. got a room that didn't get a view. also be careful if you go around the bobocabin location, because you found some cat feces on the stairs. drink only get 2 bottles of mineral water, no refill. if you buy at bobocabin the price is quite good .... breakfast gets 3 choices: fried rice, uduk rice and sandwich. the taste is just ordinary, not okay. no coffee provided, so if you are a coffee drinker, prepare your own. the good room location is upstairs, you can get a view of the city lights. but you have to climb quite a high staircase. so it is not recommended for bringing elderly or children. and the worst thing is the lights in the room. sophisticated lights that can change color, but once turned off, they all go out immediately, so if you want to go to the toilet at night, turning on the lights will wake up the people in the room. not really. very annoying. room service is responsive when called. dinner is not complete according to the menu, there is no shabu menu. only bbq is available. soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, towels, tissues, and hot water are okay.",4 months,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,"lokasi di gunung mas yang masih alam, jadi segar udaranya. karena sering gerimis, udara jadi dingin dan sering berkabut. lokasi parkir dan tempat menginap berseberangan, jadi agak repot kalau bawa barang yang tidak minimal. jadi harus drop off di lobby. lokasi menginap juga agak kurang bagus aksesnya, puterannya tidak terlalu terlihat, dan agak tinggi dan berbatu. mobil hati-hati kena bawahnya. saya lihat mobil ada yang kena bawahnya. lebih baik puter balik dulu baru naik ke lokasi menginap. lobby minimalis. untuk menginap di bobocabin, kita harus download aplikasinya ya. karena check ini, akses pintu kamar, room service, dan bahkan untuk mengendalikan jendela kamar pakai aplikai bobocabin. kecewa banget kita dapat kamar dengan cara random, tidak bisa memilih kamar. dapat kamar yang tidak mendapatkan view. hati-hati juga kalau keliling lokasi bobocabin, karena menemukan beberapa kotoran kucing di tangganya. minum hanya dapat 2 botol air mineral, tidak ada refill. kalau beli di bobocabin lumayan juga harganya…. makan pagi dapat 3 pilihan: nasi goreng, nasi uduk dan sandwich. rasa biasa saja, kurang oke sih. tidak disediakan kopi, jadi kalau peminum kopi, siapkan sendiri ya. lokasi kamar yang oke ada di atas2 bisa dapat view city light. tapi harus naik tangga yang lumayan tinggi. jadi enggak rekomen buat bawa orang tua atau anak-anak. dan yang paling enggak, lampu di kamar. lampu canggih yang bisa berubah warna, tapi sekali dimatikan langsung mati semua, jadi kalau malam mau ke toilet, nyalain lampu bakalan bangunin orang sekamar. enggak banget deh. ganggu sekali. room service tanggap untuk dipanggil. makan malam tidak lengkap sesuai dengan di menu, menu shabu2 tidak ada. hanya tersedia bbq.  sabun, shampoo, sikat gigi , odol, handuk, tisu, dan air panas oke."

Suci Ayunda,5.0,"The first experience staying at bobocabin turned out to be fun! You can laze around while fiddling with apps and tabs. We stayed in executive cabin no. 27. The executive cabin is located higher than the deluxe type so you can still get a beautiful mountain view. The cons are that the higher it is, the more stairs there are. Not suitable for bringing elderly people. However, the staff are quite responsive in helping to carry things to the room and parking lot. There are several cabins that are located very high, so the view must be really good, namely cabin 31 and cabin 10. But my knees are shaking seeing the stairs hehe. There are 3 choices for breakfast, namely fried rice, uduk rice and sandwiches. The choice is determined directly at check-in. However, the taste is so-so. In the executive cabin, there is 1 king bed and 1 queen bed, enough for 4 adults and 2 children. In my opinion, the equipment in the cabin is sufficient and functional compared to other glamping places. The bathroom is modern with all the equipment using the Toto brand. Hot water is also very smooth. Before check-in, it is better to install the bobobox app and upload your ID card first so that the check-in process is much faster. Door access, 24-hour communication, and on-off lights can be done via the app. The only drawback is that during the day, cabin 27 is very hot, even though the AC has been fully lowered to 17 degrees because the direction of the sun during the day and evening is directly directed at the cabin wall and there are no trees blocking it.",5 months,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,"pengalaman pertama menginap di bobocabin ternyata seru! bisa leyeh-leyeh sambil ngutak ngatik apps dan tabsnya.  kami menginap di cabin eksekutif no. 27. untuk kabin eksekutif lokasinya diatas dibanding tipe deluxe sehingga masih dapat view gunung yang cantik. cons nya adalah makin tinggi, makin banyak tangga. kurang cocok jika membawa orang tua. namun petugas cukup sigap membantu membawakan barang-barang ke kamar dan parkiran.  ada beberapa kabin yang lokasinya sangat tinggi, jadi viewnya kayaknya pasti bagus banget, yaitu cabin 31 dan cabin 10. tapi dengkul geter lihat tangganya hehe.  breakfast ada 3 pilihan yaitu nasi goreng, nasi uduk dan sandwhich. pilihan langsung ditentukan saat check-ini. namun rasanya biasa saja.  di cabin eksekutif, terdapat 1 kasur king dan 1 kasur queen, cukup untuk 4 dewasa dan 2 anak. perlengkapan di cabin menurut saya cukup dan fungsional dibandingkan tempat-tempat glamping lainnya. kamar mandi modern dengan semua peralatan menggunakan merk toto. air panas juga lancar jaya.  sebelum check-ini sebaiknya install apps bobobox dan upload ktp terlebih dahulu sehingga proses check-ini jauh lebih cepat. akses pintu, komunikasi 24hr, dan on-off lampu bisa dilakukan melalui apps.  kekurangannya hanya satu, yaitu saat siang cabin 27 sangat panas, walau ac sudah poll diturunkan ke 17 derajat karena arah matahari siang dan sore langsung mengarah ke dinding kabin dan tidak ada pepohonan yang menghalangi."

Zeneth Thobarony,5.0,"first time trying bobocabin! actually aiming for the baturaden one, so this gunung mas one had a bit of a low expectation. turned out to be very satisfying! it's located in the gunung mas agrotourism complex, so you have to pay per vehicle and per person. but if you want to go in and out during your stay, you can pay without paying again, as long as you tell the officer at the agrotourism gate. we ordered an executive cabin (king + queen bed), from the start the CS told us that the position was above. we were actually aiming for the top hehe, even though we didn't get cabin 31 (the highest :'). we are a family with 3 children (8, 4, 3). the children can climb up by themselves. the bobocabin staff also helped us carry our stuff. even so, still pack savvy, because if you bring too much stuff, it's hard to move around in the room. we brought our own equipment to grill our food. there's no refrigerator in the room, but you can ask for the bobocabin freezer. Even though my cabin isn't the top one, thank God it's next to a communal room and a sharing kitchen (contains a sink and microwave), so going back and forth to wash dishes and microwave popcorn is easy hehe).  for breakfast it says at 7, but in reality it's only ready at 7. There are only choices of uduk rice, fried rice and sandwiches.  Oh yes, the children were really happy going around the bobocabin area up and down the exploration stairs. Then around there is a tea garden, the kids like to go in and out because they say it's like a maze hehe. For example, the car park is far away, so we went down to the parking lot via the tea garden maze to take a shortcut.  Bobocabin Gunung Mas is as complex as agrotourism activities, so if you use a car with a small engine, you can find fun agrotourism entertainment. the famous one is the donut srodotan. flying fox, and tea bridge.  As for the situation inside the cabin, there are some cracks, especially in the bathroom, because the partition is made of plywood, but nevermind.  so far very satisfied. This is perfect for slow traveling who want to laze around enjoying nature and do a little bit of nature activities. Not recommended for the elderly because the climb is quite steep.",6 months,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,"pertama kali mencoba bobocabin! sebenarnya ngincar yang baturaden, jadi yang gunung mas ini agak low expectation. ternyata sangat memuaskan!  dia posisinya di komplek agrowisata gunung mas, jadi harus bayar per-kendaraan dan per-jumlah orang. tapi kalau mau keluar masuk selama nginap bisa enggak bayar lagi kok, asal bilang sama petugas di gerbang agrowisata.  kita pesan cabin executive (yang king + queen bed), dari awal sudah dibilang sama cs posisinya di atas. kita memang incar di atas sih sebenarnya hehe, meski enggak dapat cabin 31 (paling tinggi :’).  kami keluarga dengan anak 3 (8, 4, 3). anak-anak bisa mandiri naik sendiri. barang juga dibantuin bawa sama staff bobocabin. meski begitu, tetap packing savvy ya, soalnya kalau kebanyakan bawa barang, susah melangkah di dalam ruangan.  kami bawa perlengkapan buat bakar-bakaran makanan kami sendiri. di kamar enggak ada kulkas, tapi bisa nitip freezer bobocabin. meski cabin saya bukan paling atas, tapi alhamdulillah sebelahan dengan ruang komunal dan sharing kitchen (isinya sink dan microwave), jadi bolak balik cuci piring sama microwave popcorn gampang hehe).  untuk sarapan katanya jam 7, tapi kenyataannya baru ready jam 7-an. cuma ada pilihan nasi uduk, nasi goreng, dan sandwich.  oh ya, anak-anak hepi banget keliling area bobocabin naik turun tangga eksplorasi. terus disekitaran ada kebun teh, bocah senang keluar masuk karena katanya kayak maze hehe. contohnya kan parkiran mobil jauh, itu kami turun ke parkiran lewat maze kebun teh biar jalan pintas.  bobocabin gunung mas sekomplek sama aktivitas agrowisata, jadi pakai mobil ngiterin dikit, ketemu keriaan hiburan agrowisata. yang terkenal ada srodotan donat. flying fox, sama tea bridge.  untuk keadaan dalam cabin, ada yang agak rerak terutama di bagian kamar mandi, soalnya kan sekatnya pakai triplek begitu, but nevermind.  so far puas banget. ini cocok banget buat slow travelling yang pengin malas-malasan menikmati alam dan tipis-tipis kegiatan di alam.  tidak rekomendasi untuk orang tua karena naiknya cukup lumayan."
Irfan,3.0,nice view and ambiance. but service is lacking. breakfast is late to arrive.,6 months,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,view dan nuansa bagus. tapi pelayanan kurang. sarapan telat datang.
ini Emailku,4.0,"not suitable for those brought by parents.  the room is nice, but it turns out that it is still not cold here and not all cabins can see the city lights from afar.  so here there are two types, ordinary and executive. the usual place is below the executive above. it's true that the view above is quite good, but the climb is also quite tiring.  the experience of sleeping in the cabin is also good, barcode scanning is included, inside there are LEDs that can be changed, there is a background sound of the river/forest. only the bathroom doesn't have a lock, so if you bring a child and play around, it won't be comfortable if you want to take a shower/shower.  The view is pretty good, especially at night when the lights are on, but yes, it suits my taste, and when I came here yesterday, it wasn't cold at night.  good overall, but only once here is enough.  there are a few things that are lacking in my opinion 1. we still have to pay for the entrance ticket to Gunung mas, even though we have already stayed, it should be free for those who stay. 2. The motorcycle parking can be near the lobby, but the car parking is below and it's quite a distance, it's just complicated if you want to pick up the items you left behind. 3. going up to the cabin is quite tiring, not suitable for the elderly. but if the parents are strong, it's okay. 4. this staff lacks a set or really forgot I don't know, I ordered wood for the bonfire, he already accepted it, he said it can be delivered later, but he wants to check the availability first. but until the night there was no news, so I made a bete, wanted to go down to ask and was already tired, tired of walking. 5. The breakfast is normal. he said it could be delivered, but it wasn't delivered until 7 o'clock, finally he was sent to the restaurant. and it turns out it's not ready yet, have to wait. already said from cabin number so, he said to wait for a while. but it hasn't been delivered until half an hour. eh even the people who came after me have already been given that. I thought it was different, but I just remembered that there are only 3 types of breakfast, fried rice, fried rice and sandwiches. and after being approached again it is only given, and even that has to wait. after the food came, I thought it was still warm, but it turned out that all the food was cold, so why do I have to wait half an hour 😩, this is really bad, and it just feels bad.  but btw this is my experience, it can be different for each person.  oh yes, I think the cabin with the best view is no. 31, 10 and if I remember correctly no. 20. with the same price but the view is more, but no. 31 is the highest, so yes, going to the cabin also makes you tired.",6 months,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,"tidak cocok buat yang bawa orang tua.  kamarnya bagus, cuma ternyata disini masih belum dingin dan enggak disemua kabin bisa lihat lampu kota dari jauh.  jadi disini ada dua tipe, yang biasa dan eksekutif. yang biasa tempatnya dibawah yang eksekutif di atas. memang yang diatas view nya agak bagus, tapi naeknya juga lumayan capek.  pengalaman tidur di kabin juga lumayan, masuknya scan barcode, di dalam ada led yang bisa diubah2, ada backsound suara sungai/hutan. cuma kamar mandinya enggak ada kuncinya, jadi kalo bawa anak dan iseng jadi enggak nyaman kalo mau pup/mandi.  view nya lumayan bagus, apalagi pas malam lampu2 nya dinyalain, tapi ya sesuai selera sih, dan pas saya kesini kemarin, pas malam enggak dingin.  overall lumayan, tapi cukup sekali saja kesini.  ada beberapa yang kurang menurut saya 1. kita tetap harus bayar tiket masuk ke gunung mas, padahal sudah nginep harusnya sih gratis buat yang nginep. 2. parkiran motor bisa dekat loby, tapi parkiran mobil ada di bawah dan jaraknya lumayan, ribet saja sih kalo mau ambil barang yang ketinggalan. 3. naik ke kabin nya lumayan capek, tidak cocok buat orang tua. tapi kalo orang tuanya kuat sih enggak apa-apa juga. 4.ini stafnya kurang sat set atau memang lupa saya enggak tau, saya pesan kayu buat api unggun,dia sudah nyanggupin iya, katanya nanti bisa diantar, tapi mau di cek dulu ketersediannya. tapi sampai malam enggak ada kabar, jadi bikin bete, mau ke bawah nanyain juga sudah malea, capek jalannya. 5.sarapannya biasa saja. katanya bisa diantar, tapi sudah sampai jam 7 lewat enggak diantar, akhirnya disamperin ke tempat makan. dan ternyata masih belum siap harus menunggu. sudah bilang dari kabin nomor sekian, katanya suruh menunggu sebentar. tapi sampai setengah jam belum juga diantar. eh malah orang yang datang setelah saya sudah pada dikasih makanya. saya kira makannya beda, ternyata baru ingat, sarapannya cuma ada 3 macam, nasi goreng, nasi uduk dan sandwich. dan setelah didatangi lagi baru dikasih, dan itupun harus menunggu. setelah makannya datang, saya kira masih anget, ternyata semua makannya dingin, lah kalo begitu mengapai saya harus menunggu setengah jam  😩, ini parah sih, dan rasanya b saja.  tapi btw ini pengalaman saya, bisa jadi berbeda di setiap orang.  oh iya, cabin yang view nya bagus itu menurut saya no 31, 10 dan kalo enggak salah ingat no 20. dengan harga yang sama tapi viewnya lebih, tapi no 31 itu paling atas, jadi ya ke kabin nya juga bikin capek."

I ordered bbq beef and marshmallows and it came 1.5 hours later without saying sorry sir 5. The beef is a lot and the seasoning is not good. 6. I was told to be quiet in this location, but why is it that early in the morning at 6 o'clock there is someone cutting the grass that makes so much noise that I complained to his father, but he just turned it off and then turned it on again?! I was told to be calm here and wanted to spend the night in peace, but it became chaotic, sorry, because the sound of the mosque is very loud and the sound of the lawnmower is super noisy from 6 in the morning? really?

Searvisa,5.0,"bobocabin location is inside agrowisata gunungmas. so if you want to enter pay 20 thousand per adult even if you stay at bobocabin. the position is not far from the entrance, only the car park and bobo cabin itself are not next to each other and uphill, so you can go to bobocabin first to put your stuff and later the car will be parked by the officer. the service is extraordinary, because the cabin position is some close and some far uphill, there are officers who help carry stuff to the cabin, so visitors are not overwhelmed. for the view from the room, luckily, the higher the cabin, the better the view. most of the 4person/room rooms have good views because the position is above. yesterday we got breakfast and chose between 3 menus. and the menu selection was submitted no later than 7 pm, you can buy barbecue and/or steambot, order it before 7 pm. the room has a 15l water heater and air conditioning, if it's cold at night so you don't need to turn on the air conditioning. but during the day it starts to get hot and the air conditioning works well. top deh",7 months,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,"lokasi bobocabin ada di dalam agrowisata gunungmas. sehingga kalo mau masuk bayar 20rb per orang dewasa walau menginap di bobocabin. posisinya enggak jauh dari pintu masuk, hanya lokasi parkiran mobil dan bobo cabinnya sendiri tidak bersebelahan dan menanjak, jadi bisa ke bobocabin dulu taruh barang dan nanti mobil diparkirkan oleh petugasnya. servicenya luar biasa, karena posisi cabin ada yang dekat dan ada yang jauh menanjak, ada petugas yang bantu bawa barang ke cabin, sehingga pengunjung tidak kewalahan. untuk view dari kamar untung2an ya, semakin tinggi cabin semakin bagus viewnya. kebanyakan yang kamar 4org/room yang viewnya bagus karena posisinya diatas. kemarin dapat sarapan dan pilih antara 3 menu. dan pemilihan menu diajukan paling lambat jam 7 malam, bisa beli barberque dan/atau steambot pesennya juga sebelum jam 7 malam. kamarnya ada water heater 15l dan ac, kalo malam dingin jadi enggak perlu nyalain ac. tapi pas siang mulai panas dan ac nya berkerja dengan baik. top deh"

Sheila Laibahas,4.0,"overall a great experience! the place is suitable for all atmospheres, for family vacations, gathering with friends, or couples. worth it for the price of 700 thousand + per night. I will review each point one by one so you know what to expect and prepare: 1. cabins - the cabin is compact, but not uncomfortably small. it's decently sized, and there are also different room sizes available so it can be adjusted to the number of people. the smart window (?) is fun! there are special sound effects of river sounds or forest birds chirping. the lights can also be changed, the window glass can be blurred as needed. the bathroom is nice, there is 15l of hot water. if it runs out, it takes 2 hours to heat it up again. there is a coffee pot, cups, and mineral water. there is no refrigerator. the bed and pillows are comfortable, the blanket is thick so you don't have to worry about getting cold. wifi is available, yes sometimes it's not that fast but it's quite good. 2. location - important to note, the parking lot is far away (from other reviews, many may have said so). It's a long way and the road is rocky, so if you can, don't bring a suitcase because you won't be able to pull it, you have to carry it. The road will be a bit uphill, and later the location of the cabins will also be high, so get ready to lift things while hiking a little. At night there are lots of lights, it's really beautiful. 3. service - top!! the hosts and staff are all very nice. ready to help. We were offered to be taken by motorbike or borrowed the motorbike to get to/from the parking lot because it was so far away. When I just arrived, the security guy helped carry the bags using his motorbike because the Komodo vehicle he was helping carry was broken. This message also arrived quickly. everyone is really friendly. 4. Check-in process - before coming, research first, the bobocabin uses a smart lock. So the key is using a QR code, from your cellphone. So when you check it you will be asked to download the Bobobox application. Don't worry, the host will help you, and all your needs will be done through the application. would you like to ask for extra towels? order food? ask this or that? just chat with the host from the application. So don't grumble if you're told to install the application. The check-in process is fast and really easy. 5. Access - because the location is quite deep, finding food is a bit difficult. but if you bring a private car, that's no problem. There's someone on guard until evening, so don't worry if you come back at night. You can order food here too, the price is more expensive but yes it's also a hotel, everything is definitely more expensive. but it's not something that doesn't matter, it's also expensive. If you don't want to, just gofood. Later, Brother GoFood will deliver you to the lobby, from the lobby, the Bobocabin staff will deliver it to your place.  Overall, I think this is worth the price. Yes, don't expect this to be excessive either, the price is 700 thousand, not 2 million per night. Happy holiday!",a year,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,"overall a great experience! tempatnya cocok untuk semua suasana, buat liburan keluarga, kumpul-kumpul bareng teman, atau couples. worth it untuk harganya 700ribu+ per malam. ku review satu-satu poinnya so you know what to expect and prepare: 1. cabins - the cabin is compact, but not uncomfortably small. it's decently sized, dan tersedia juga ukuran kamar berbeda kok jadi bisa disesuaikan dengan jumlah orangnya. the smart window(?) is fun! ada special sound effects suara sungai atau hutan kicau burung begitu. lampunya juga bisa diganti-ganti, kaca jendela bisa di-blur sesuai kebutuhan. the bathroom is nice, ada air panas 15l. kalo dipakai sampai habis banget, butuh 2 jam untuk panasin lagi. ada coffee pot, cangkir, dan air mineral. enggak ada kulkas. tempat tidur dan bantalnya nyaman, selimutnya tebal jadi enggak usah khawatir kedinginan. wifi tersedia, ya kadang enggak begitu kencang juga tapi lumayan kok. 2. lokasi - penting buat diperhatikan, tempat parkirnya jauh (dari review-review lain juga mungkin banyak yang bilang ya). memang jauh dan jalannya berbatu-batu, jadi kalo bisa jangan bawa koper karena enggak bakal bisa ditarik juga, mesti ditenteng. jalannya bakal agak nanjak begitu, dan nanti lokasi cabins nya pun bisa dapat yang tinggi, jadi siap-siap buat angkat barang sambil hiking dikit ya. malam banyak lampu-lampu, cantik banget. 3. servis - top!! host dan staff-nya semuanya baik banget. sigap siap membantu. kita ditawarin untuk diantar pakai motor atau dipinjemin motornya buat ke / dari tempat parkir karena jauh itu tadi. pas baru datang pun bapak security nya bantu bawain tas-tas pakai motor karena kendaraan komodo yang buat bantu bawanya lagi rusak. pesan ini itu juga cepat datengnya. semua ramah banget pokoknya. 4. proses check-ini - sebelum datang riset dulu ya, bobocabin itu pakai smart lock. jadi kuncinya itu pakai qr code, dari hp kamu. jadi pas check-ini memang bakal diminta buat download aplikasi bobobox. don't worry, bakal dibantu kok sama host nya, dan semua keperluan kamu itu memang lewat aplikasi itu. mau meminta handuk tambahan? pesan makanan? tanya ini itu? tinggal chat host dari aplikasi. jadi jangan ngedumel ya kalo disuruh install aplikasi. proses check-ini nya cepat dan gampang banget kok. 5. akses - karena lokasinya agak dalem, memang cari makan agak susah sih. tapi kalo bawa mobil pribadi ya enggak masalah. sampai malam ada yang jaga, so don't worry kalo kamu baliknya malam. makanan bisa pesan di sini juga, memang harganya lebih mahal tapi ya namanya juga hotel, semua pasti lebih mahal lah. tapi bukan yang enggak ngotak juga mahalnya. kalo indak mau ya gofood saja. nanti abang gofood nganter sampai lobby, dari lobby staff nya bobocabin yang antarkan ke tempat kamu.  overall ini menurutku worth the price. ya jangan mengharap ini itu yang berlebihan juga, kan harganya 700ribuan, bukan 2 juta per malam. selamat liburan!"

Fransiska Adi Saputra,5.0,"Apr 27-28, 2023, I was very happy when I was small, and the receptionist told me that it was cabin 31. Actually, I had read a google review before and it said that cabin 31 was the favorite home, and the view from the room was good. but as soon as you know that cabin 31 is at the top itself, hm, the way up there is really tiring. the room is good, quite clean, all facilities are on. for the deficiency is in the part of the water line, it is so clogged that it takes a long time for the water/soap-shampoo foam to come down in the shower room. besides that, the wifi is also very difficult to get the signal, maybe because cabin 31 is above itself. then there is a problem with parking because there is not one parking place, aka it is across from the location of the cabana, so if you pass the check, you can park 2-3 cars, but only temporarily if you really want to park overnight across from the location, it was like that yesterday when I asked for a car, no one came to pick me up there is still an uphill path but my mnrt is still not very worthy because the ground is still so slippery and dark like that (the meeting was yesterday just at night) the staff are all friendly and quick. Oh, for those with 4-wheeled vehicles, be very careful, the road when you enter the bobocabin area is really short but steep because there are holes (the road is not conblock but still rocky) so the car tires are a bit difficult to climb and the front bumper is hit by rocks that. I have also given input to the receptionist, but he said that it was indeed the potholed entrance that was still being managed and permission to fix it was given to the authorities there. for those who want to try glamping in style, please don't bring a suitcase because it will make it difficult for you, because the road is uphill and complicated if you use a suitcase.

Shinta Agustin,3.0,"I stayed in cabin 23, the mattress was dirty with lots of hair, the area around the bed was also dusty as if it had never been maintained or was cleaned carelessly, finally I took the initiative to wipe it with tissue, when it rained, water entered through the gap in the door and the floor inside became wet and there was no mat provided at the entrance (the canopy should have been modified at the main door so that rainwater does not enter the room floor), there was also a gap in the door so I was worried that animals would enter the room (maybe in the future they could provide a pad or something to close the gap), when it rained, water entered through the gap in the window, there were no sandals, no breakfast, no TV. outside the cabin there were also lots of spider webs even though it was a new hotel, with a price that I think is not cheap, I ordered through a travel agent 2 weeks in advance for the lowest type (deluxe) for almost 1.2 million. with a price like that, bobocabin should be able to sell at least in terms of cleanliness so that guests are more comfortable. when I stayed, there were outsiders who got lost, maybe they entered through the tea plantation, maybe they could have given information around the edges of the tea plantation that ""it is not a public place or road"", also in the entrance alley so that they could give directions to the bobocabin position because I got lost because the directions were only on the other side of the entrance alley. for the staff and security officers who are helpful. hopefully it can be considered and improved in the future, because with a hotel that is not yet 1/2 years old, it would be a shame if it was not maintained, I'm afraid customers would leave. hopefully it will be more successful. thank you",a year,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,"saya menginap di cabin 23, kasur kotor banyak rambut, sekitar tempat tidur juga berdebu seperti enggak pernah dirawat atau dibersihkannya ngasal, akhirnya inisiatif lap pakai tissue, ketika hujan air masuk lewat celah pintu dan lantai dalam jadi basah dan tidak disediakan keset dipintu masuk (seharusnya modif canopy di pintu utama agar air hujan enggak masuk ke lantai kamar), juga ada celah dipintu sehingga khawatir ada binatang masuk ke kamar (mungkin kedepannya bisa di kasih bantalan atau semacamnya untuk menutup celah tersebut), saat selepas hujan air masuk lewat celah jendela, tidak ada sandal, tidak dapat sarapan, tidak ada tv. diluar cabin juga banyak sarang laba2 padahal tergolong hotel baru, dengan harga yang menurut saya enggak murah, saya pesan lewat travel agent 2 minggu sebelumnya untuk type terbawah (deluxe) seharga hampir 1,2 juta. seharusnya dengan harga seperti itu bobocabin bisa menjual seenggaknya dari segi kebersihan jadi tamupun semakin nyaman. saat saya menginap, ada orang luar nyasar mungkin masuk kewat perkebunan teh, mungkin bisa diberi keterangan disekitar pinggir2 perbatasan kebun teh bahwa ""bukan tempat atau jalan umum"", juga untuk di gang masuk agar dapat diberikan petunjuk posisi bobocabin karena saya sempat nyasar karn petunjuk hanya ada di sebrang jalan gang masuk. untuk staff dan petugas keamanan helpfull. semoga bisa dijadikan perhatian dan perbaikan kedepannya, karena dengan umur hotel yang belum 1/2 tahun sayang kalau tidak dirawat takutnya ditinggal pelanggan. semoga semakin sukses. terima kasih"

Ihsan A. Rasyid,3.0,"Arriving on a weekday and checking in early, around 12 noon, it turns out that it doesn't guarantee getting a cabin with a good position. We chose a family cabin for 2 adults and 2 children, and the officer gave us cabin no. 21 which is right behind the helper cabin, so it blocks the view to the front. The officer's reason was that the other cabins were already occupied, even though it wasn't check-in time yet. Access from the car park to bobocabin must be via an uphill path, who knows what it would be like if it rained. The main access road is still being worked on, and can only be passed by motorbike. Sunny weather makes the cabin very hot, and the AC only helps a little, it's better not to stay in the cabin during the day. The hot water is also unstable, even though it uses a heater with a fairly large tank, but it's not optimal because the water pressure is a bit lacking. Overall it's quite good, but once is enough for us.",a year,Bobocabin Gunung Mas Puncak,"datang di weekday dan checkin lebih awal, sekitar jam 12, ternyata tidak menjamin bisa mendapatkan kabin dengan posisi yang ok. kami memilih family cabin untuk 2 dewasa dan 2 anak, dan petugas memberi kabin no. 21 yang posisinya tepat di belakang helper cabin, sehingga menghalangi pandangan ke depan. alasan petugas, kabin yang lain sudah terisi, padahal belum jam checkin. akses dari parkiran mobil ke bobocabin harus melalui jalan setapak yang menanjak, entah bagaimana jadinya kalo hujan. jalan akses utama masih sedang dikerja, dan hanya bisa dilalui dengan motor. cuaca cerah menyebabkan kabin menjadi sangat panas, dan ac hanya sedikit membantu, sebaiknya tidak stay di kabin di siang hari. air panas juga kurang stabil, padahal menggunakan pemanas dengan tangki lumayan besar, tapi kurang maksimal karena tekanan air agak kurang. overall cukup bagus, tapi cukup sekali buat kami."

Deltanne,4.0,"the room is unique, and bobocabin is undoubtedly a super strategic location and can see mount rinjani directly in front of your eyes.. but!! the room is really cold in the morning!! don't understand how to make it warm anymore. it's cold for more than two hours.. in the bathroom there is hot water, but the hot water is a cylinder.. so it can only be used for a very short time because the temperature outside is very cold.. maybe the cylinder also loses its heat. the hotel is good.. but the cold is unbearable!! my husband who is strong enough to be cold is also cold! get ready for the arrival of many animals. at night suddenly there are black orange animals, really scared of tomcat because their bites can itch and cause bumps.. finally call room service.. I got cabin no. 9, it's very close to room service.. but the person only came an hour later. already beaten up by himself. the location of the cabin is also below. not suitable for the elderly and not strong enough to walk.",a month,Bobocabin Gunung Rinjani Lombok,"kamarnya unik, dan bobocabin enggak perlu diragukan lagi untuk lokasi yang super strategis dan bisa lihat langsung gunung rinjani di depan mata..  tapi!! kamarnya duingin banget kalo pagi!! enggak mengerti lagi bagaimana supaya hangat. dua jam lebih kedinginan.. di dalam kamar mandi ada air panas, tapi air panasnya yang tabung.. jadi cuma bisa dipakai sangat sebentar karena suhu di luar sangat dingin.. mungkin tabungnya juga jadi ikutan kalah panasnya.  hotelnya bagus.. tapi dinginnya enggak tahan!! suami saya yang kuat dingin saja sampai kedinginan juga!  siap-siap akan kedatangan banyak hewan. malam malam tibatiba ada hewan oren hitam, takut banget tomcat karena gigitannya bisa gatel dan bikin bentol2.. akhirnya telpon room service.. saya dapat cabin no 9, itu dekat banget sama room service.. tapi orangnya baru datang sejam kemudian. sudah keburu digebug sendiri.  lokasi cabin juga di bawah. kurang cocok buat yang sudah tua dan enggak kuat jalan."

Agus Wahyudi,5.0,"first experience staying at bobocabin and everything met my expectations. the location is in sembalun, lombok (according to the position on the maps) approximately 2-3 hours from the city of mataram. road access to the location is good, parking is available quite spacious for vehicles. when you first arrive at bobocabin you are immediately presented with a view of mount rinjani which is extraordinarily beautiful. for choosing a location I think bobocabin never fails. the location is also quite close to mini markets, health centers, and tourist destinations. the size of the cabin I think is quite spacious, it doesn't feel cramped at all. water heater, bottled water, and tea are available. the bathroom is okay equipped with soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, and towels. the highlight of the cabin is of course the sophisticated control panel that can be used to change the window mode to opaque/clear, adjust the mood lamp, connect gadgets to the available speakers via bluetooth. don't be afraid of your gadget running out of battery because there are quite a lot of power outlets available. the view from the cabin is truly amazing both from outside the cabin or from inside the cabin through the available windows. some things that might be worth noting for anyone who wants to stay here: I personally feel that Sembalun is very cold at night and in the morning and afternoon it can be very hot, there are many insects in the cabin area that can sometimes enter the cabin, prepare personal medicines that you might need. don't be afraid of being hungry if you stay here because there is a delicious breakfast and other menus that collaborate with local community businesses (must try Soto Sembalun) two thumbs up for the staff of Bobocabin Sembalun whose service is really great👍👍",6 months,Bobocabin Gunung Rinjani Lombok,"pengalaman pertama menginap di bobocabin dan semuanya memenuhi ekspektasi saya.  lokasinya ada di sembalun, lombok (sesuai dengan posisi yang ada di maps) kurang lebih 2-3 jam dari kota mataram. akses jalan ke lokasi bagus, parkiran tersedia cukup luas untuk kendaraan.  saat pertama sampai di bobocabin langsung disuguhkan dengan view gunung rinjani yang luar biasa indahnya. untuk pemilihan lokasi saya rasa bobocabin memang enggak pernah gagal. lokasi juga cukup dekat dengan mini market, puskesmas, dan tempat tujuan wisata.  ukuran kabin saya rasa cukup lega, tidak terasa sempit sama sekali. tersedia pemanas air, air botolan, dan teh. kamar mandi oke dilengkapi dengan sabun, shampoo, sikat gigi, pasta gigi, dan handuk. highlight dari kabin tentu saja panel kontrol canggih yang bisa digunakan untuk mengubah mode jendela ke buram/bening, mengatur mood lamp, menyambungkan gadget ke speaker yang tersedia via bluetooth. jangan takut gadget kehabisan baterai karena colokan listrik tersedia cukup banyak.  view dari kabin benar-benar menakjubkan baik dari luar kabin atau dari dalam kabin melalui jendela yang tersedia. beberapa hal yang mungkin bisa diperhatikan untuk siapa pun yang mau menginap disini: saya secara personal merasa sembalun sangat dingin di malam hari dan di pagi siang hari bisa menjadi sangat panas, banyak serangga di area kabin yang terkadang bisa masuk ke kabin, persiapkan obat-obatan pribadi yang sekiranya anda butuhkan.  jangan takut kelaparan juga kalau menginap disini karena tersedia breakfast yang enak dan menu lain yang berkolaborasi dengan usaha masyarakat sekitar (harus coba soto sembalun)  dua jempol untuk staf bobocabin sembalun yang pelayanannya benar-benar mantap👍👍"

reeva damayanti,3.0,"1. On the way to bobocabin, I was surprised by its remote location, entering the alleys of residents, with narrow roads, even cars are afraid of the road, the road is still damaged, if you meet another car, one of you has to reverse, there are no street lights at night, the location is very far from the stalls so for lunch if you don't order at bobocabin you have to go out. and there are no gojek/gocar in this area. be grateful if you come using a private vehicle. if you are lucky you can get a local driver who is ready to take you anywhere :) 2. at the beginning I was also surprised by the flies, I thought it was because I was standing near the trash hehe. it turns out that in Kintamani there are lots of flies because it is a plantation area and uses fertilizer from chickens (they said). it's just that the flies are a bit annoying :( it's not comfortable to be outside because of the flies. 3. the price is very inappropriate, I booked a room for 1 million with a hot water bathtub facility outside according to the picture on traveloka. but in fact the tub was covered in moss, yellow water and very hot, it was like a well not a bathtub :) how could you soak there? unlike in bobocabin ubud which is indeed like a bath. if I had known I would have chosen a regular room :) 4. the room is clean but cramped, for that price :) the bathroom is also cramped and the door is hard to close. the water often gets turned off, I read per person 15 liters for 90 minutes (if I remember correctly) and I've been waiting but in fact the water is still turned off and I don't know when it will flow again. 5. check this must use the application, everything is sophisticated with the system. unfortunately the network there is not very good, so it is difficult to communicate using the application, and the lights and your windows often get stuck. and there is no wifi. 6. electricity usage is very limited. 7. breakfast must be by order 1 day in advance. and it was delivered to each room very roomy because I saw only 1 person who delivered food 1 by 1 :( and because everything is by system, bad network, if you don't answer what to eat tomorrow, no staff will come to the room to ask, you might not even eat :( the taste of the food is ordinary with such an expensive price even just enough. 8. the staff is not sensitive. we lifted the suitcase ourselves even though there was staff nearby. 9. the weather in the morning is very cold, but from 10 onwards it is very hot even inside the room even though the air conditioner is still hot, and for some reason I got dizzy being in the cabin is it because it's stuffy? no air? and the night weather is very cold. 10. my input maybe a TV can be added for entertainment at night or during the day when guests don't want to go anywhere. 11. nice view like in a painting :) 12. is there no service to clean the room?",a month,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"1. pas jalan menuju bobocabin kaget dengan lokasinya yang begitu terpencil, masuk ke lorong2 warga, dengan jalanan yang sempit bahkan mobil pun takut dengan jalan itu, jalanannya masih rusak, kalau berpapasan dengan mobil lain salah satu harus mundur, tidak ada penerang jalan kalau malam, lokasinya sangat jauh dari warung-warung sehingga untuk makan siang kalau tidak pesan di bobocabin ya harus keluar. dan tidak ada gojek/gocar di wilayah ini. bersyukur kalau datang menggunakan kendaraan pribadi. kalau beruntung bisa dapat driver lokal yang siap antar kemanapun :)  2. awal sampai kaget juga dengan lalat, saya pikir karena berdiri dekat tempat sampah hehe. ternyata di kintamani banyak lalat karena wilayah perkebunan dan menggunakan pupuk dari ayam (katanya). hanya saja lalatnya sedikit mengganggu :( kurang nyaman berada di luar ruangan karena lalat.  3. harga sangat tidak sesuai, saya memesan kamar dengan harga 1jt dengan fasilitas bak mandi air hangat yang ada di luar sesuai gambar pada traveloka. tapi nyatanya bak dengan lumut, air kuning dan sangat panas, ini seperti sumur bukan bak mandi :) mana mungkin berendam disitu ? tidak seperti di bobocabin ubud yang memang bak untuk berendam. tau begitu saya pilih kamar yang biasa :)  4. kamar bersih tetapi sempit, dengan harga segitu :) kamar mandi juga sempit dan pintunya susah ditutup. air suka dimatikan, saya baca perorang 15ltr untuk 90mnt (kalau tidak salah ingat) dan saya sudah menunggu tapi nyatanya airnya tetap dimatikan dan tidak tau kapan deras lagi.  5. check ini harus menggunakan aplikasi, semua canggih dengan sistem. sayangnya jaringan disana tidak terlalu bagus, sehingga susah berkomunikasi menggunakan aplikasi, dan lampunya serta jendelamu suka macet. dan tidak ada wifi.  6. penggunaan listrik sangat dibatasi.  7. sarapan harus by order 1 hari sebelumnya. dan itu diantarkan ke kamar masing-masing sangat kama karena saya lihat hanya 1 orang yang antar makanan 1 per 1 :( dan karena semua by sistem, jaringan jelek, kalau tidak menjawab makan apa besok, tidak ada staf yang menghampiri di kamar untuk tanya, bisa-bisa malah enggak makan :( rasa makanan biasa saja dengan harga begitu mahal bahkan hanya seadanya.  8. staf nya kurang peka. kami mengangkat koper sendiri padahal ada staf di dekat situ.  9. cuaca di pagi hari sangat dingin, tetapi mulai jam 10 ke atas sangat panas bahkan di dalam ruangan pun meski pakai ac tetap panas, dan entah kenapa saya pusing berada dalam kabin apa karena pengap ? tidak ada udara ? dan cuaca malam sangat dingin.  10. masukan saya mungkin bisa ditambahkan tv untuk hiburan saat malam atau siang saat tamu tidak ingin kemana2.  11. pemandangan bagus seperti di lukisan :)  12. apakah tidak ada service untuk bersihkan kamar ?"
Ragil Intan Novitasari,4.0,"before i choose this acomodation i've read a lot of review from ag*di* actually, that's why i try my best to reach this place before night fall.  since i trust google maps for direction, also to this accomodation, i've choosen the shortest path, but it also a nerve-wrecking path.  about 3km long before our destination, we've been directed to the small and steep road (about 50 - 70 slope degrees), we take this hellish road (especially for car) about 1km long and finally got normal road (even it's still quite narrow), after 1,5km we've got directed to another insanely small road which is only passable by motorbike (probably, as i saw it), luckily, we selamat a local resident wise enough to prevent us going through those route.  then, he direct us to another path, a little bumpy but passed well. and finally, we reached this acomodation after dusk (just after sunset).  and the fun fact is, we decide to take another route, which is far reasonable, and suitable for normal-human.  there's no desk at the lobby and only 1 receptionist guiding us. to di check ini, i download bobobo* aplication, fill ini my data and then check ini process through this apps, we didn't get physical key, as to open the door we simply scan barcode through bobobo* aplication.  as for check out process, is also by bobobo* apps. but, still needs confirmation by the staff on site.  i booked deluxe room, which is the cheapest room i thought, but i don't feel any big difference about the service. i got room number 26 which is close to the lobby.  for the room it's must be standard for the cabin, quite small 2,25 kali 6 sama aproximately, but it clean, smell good and still well maintain. there is a lot of instruction inside the room, about the fly, the water and more.  personaly i'sama not satisfied with the water heater cause it's provide small amount of water, which is i dont finish my bath and the water turn cold. the heating proses also take too long.  and for the bathroom it's leaked if we don't close ia properly, good thing is the shower type memakai it easier for us, muslim to take a wudhu.  i also didn't matched the toilet type, which didn't provide a bidet, so it's hard for me who travel with kids.  they provide hair driyer but i don't use it.  the ac performance was great, it warm us ini the night and chill us ini the noon, it makes the room comfortable.

Lorenz Abraham Pesik,2.0,"Honest review of Bobocabin Kintamani 1. Access is very difficult, the road is gravel and can only be passed by 1 car, so if there is a car coming from the opposite direction, be prepared to have to give way.  2. The service is very bad, there are no employees to help with lifting things, today I checked out from the lowest room number 15 lifting quite a lot of things and the officers just looked at them and didn't help at all and didn't even greet the guests.  3. The rooms are very narrow, so if someone wants to spend the night here it's best to bring only what they need. the room price does not match the room.  4. The view? don't doubt it, it's definitely good.  5. Advice if you want to spend the night here, it's best to come before dark because there is no lighting on the access road to the bobocabin.",2 months,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"review jujur bobocabin kintamani  1. akses sangat sulit, jalan bebatuan krikil dan hanya bisa dilalui 1 mobil, jadi kalau ada mobil dari lawan arah siap² harus ada yang mengalah.  2. service sangat buruk, tidak ada karyawan yang membantu untuk angkat barang², hari ini check out saya dari kamar paling bawah nomor 15 angkat barang² cukup banyak dan petugas hanya melihat saja tidak membantu sama sekali bahkan tidak menyapa tamu nya.  3. untuk kamar sangat sempit, jadi kalau ada yang ingin bermalam disini baiknya membawa barang seperlunya saja. harga kamar tidak sesuai dengan kamarnya.  4. view nya? jangan di ragukan lagi sudah pasti bagus.  5. saran jika ingin bermalam disini baiknya datang sebelum gelap karena tidak ada penerangan jalan akses menuju bobocabin."

Jaka Dharma,1.0,"I have to give an honest review, on my experience staying overnight at bobocabin kintamani, .. I stayed with my family at that time, I only stayed 1 day at bobocabin kintamani, because in the high season on the 2024 Eid holiday, finally I booked 2 room types (deluxe cabin & executive cabin) that were available on that day. long story short, the value for money is very inappropriate !! with a price of more than 3.6 million at that time (in high season), what I felt when staying at bobocabin kintamani did not match the price that had been spent. I myself stayed in the executive cabin room type (the highest type at bobocabin kintamani). the condition of the room which in my opinion is not well maintained, starting from the iron handle door that looks worn out plus the addition of a broken mosquito repellent door. the bitter experience is not only there, when I used the bathroom to take a shower in the afternoon, the leak from the bathroom seemed to pool out of the shower box, as a result the bathroom area looked muddy with water coming out. the reservation process, room booking, to check-in and check-out does look quite sophisticated and contemporary and also updated with technology in the form of applications directly from the guest's cellphone, but it is very clear that the management of Bobocabin Kintamani here seems to want to save money! and maybe reluctant to increase the number of employees for Bobocabin Kintamani, you can imagine the reservation process at that time was only assisted by 1 employee on duty, even I also did not have the heart even though the employee wanted to help lift my suitcases / belongings, even though you can imagine from a total of 31 cabins in Bobocabin Kintamani I only saw a few employees at that time. instead it seemed deserted. the next day at breakfast provided by Bobocabin Kintamani, the breakfast available was only American breakfast and Indonesian breakfast variants, what surprised me enough to have difficulty speaking was the appearance of the food menu when served to me and my family. which is very..very..very not in accordance with the price that was charged to guests at that time. American breakfast and Indonesian breakfast seem to be made with just a little bit, even like toys, the taste is also very messy with the quality of food ingredients which in my opinion are very low, bread, sausage, beef bacon etc. I myself am quite surprised that Bobocabin is not only in Kintamani Bali, but also in several other cities in Indonesia and other natural attractions, but is this all the quality? try asking the management of Bobocabin Kintamani yourself, you set a room price but with a room quality like that for your guests who will stay at Bobocabin ?? I'm sure many may agree with me, to write an honest review like this, but it seems like it was not done because it felt lazy, a waste of time or maybe take action to just stay at Bobocabin Kintamani once because you will think twice about staying again at Bobocabin Kintamani, but on the other hand I have to give this assessment so that the management of Bobocabin Kintamani must improve and open their eyes to these shortcomings. I also have to give a fair assessment, that the communal area located in the right area of ​​the lobby is very good and also the friendliness of the employees is very good to serve the guests who stay. and one more thing, my suggestion is that the management of bobocabin kintamani must also be fair, because bad reviews are never posted on the bobobox application, even though it should be a consideration for bobocabin kintamani management to be able to evaluate your service. thank you jack.",2 months,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"saya harus memberikan review yang jujur, atas pengalaman saya bermalam di bobocabin kintamani,..  saya menginap bersama dengan keluarga saya saat itu , saya menginap hanya 1 hari di bobocabin kintamani, karena di musim yang high season di libur lebaran 2024 , akhirnya saya memesan 2 unit tipe kamar (deluxe cabin & executive cabin) yang terdapat di hari tersebut.  singkat cerita , value for money sangatlah tidak sesuai !! dengan harga lebih dari 3,6 juta saat itu (di high season ) , apa yang saya rasakan saat menginap di bobocabin kintamani tidaklah sesuai dengan harga yang sudah dikeluarkan .  saya sendiri menginap di tipe kamar executive cabin ( tipe yang tertinggi di bobocabin kintamani ). kondisi kamar yang menurut saya kurang terawat, dari mulai pintu handle besi yang terlihat sudah usang ditambah dengan tambahan pintu anti nyamuk yang sudah rusak. pengalaman pahit tidak hanya disitu , saat saya menggunakan kamar mandi untuk mandi di sore hari, bocor dari kamar mandi tampak menggenang ke luar dari shower box , alhasil area kamar mandi tampak becek dengan air yang keluar.  proses pemesanan, booking kamar, hingga check-ini dan check-out memang terlihat cukup canggih dan kekinian dan juga update dengan teknologi berbentuk aplikasi langsung dari hp tamu, namun tampak jelas sekali manajemen bobocabin kintamani disini terkesan mau irit ! dan mungkin enggan menambah jumlah karyawan untuk bobocabin kintamani , anda bisa bayangkan proses reservasi saat itu hanya dibantu oleh 1 orang karyawan saja yang bertugas, bahkan saya juga tidak tega meskipun karyawan tersebut ingin membantu untuk mengangkat koper2 /barang saya , padahal bisa dibayangkan dari total 31 cabin yang terdapat di bobocabin kintamani saya hanya melihat beberapa karyawan saja saat itu. malah terkesan terlihat seperti sepi .  keesokan harinya disaat sarapan pagi yang disediakan oleh bobocabin kintamani, sarapan yang tersedia yaitu hanya ada varian american breakfast dan juga indonesia breakfast, yang cukup mengagetkan saya hingga susah berucap ialah tampilan menu makanan tersebut saat dihidangkan ke saya dan keluarga saya .yakni sangat..sangat..sangat tidak sesuai dengan harga yang saat itu dikenakan kepada tamu.  makanan american breakfast dan juga indonesia breakfast terkesan dibuat hanya dengan sekedarnya saja malah seperti terlihat seperti mainan , rasanya pun berantakan sekali dengan kualitas bahan makanan yang menurut saya sangat rendah,roti,sosis,beef bacon dll.  saya sendiri cukup kaget bobocabin bukan hanya ada di kintamani bali , namun ada juga di beberapa kota lain di indonesia dan wisata alam lainnya, tapi apa begini semua kualitasnya ? coba tanyakan sendiri ke manajemen bobocabin kintamani , kalian mematok harga kamar tapi dengan kualitas kamar seperti itu ke tamu kalian yang akan menginap di bobocabin ??  saya yakin mungkin banyak yang sependapat dengan saya, untuk menulis review jujur seperti ini , namun itu urung dilakukan kayaknya karena terasa malas , buang2 waktu atau mungkin ambil tindakan untuk cukup 1 kali saja menginap di bobocabin kintamani karena akan mikir dua kali untuk menginap lagi di bobocabin kintamani , namun disisi lain saya harus memberikan penilaian ini agar manajemen bobocabin kintamani harus berbenah dan membuka matanya atas kekurangan kekurangan tersebut.  saya juga harus memberikan penilaian yang adil , bahwa area communal yang terdapat di area kanan dari lobby sangat bagus dan juga keramah tamahan para pegawai nya sangat baik untuk melayani para tamu yang menginap.  dan satu lagi , saran saya manajemen bobocabin kintamani juga harus adil , karena review yang kurang baik tidak pernah ada di posting di aplikasi bobobox , padahal itu seharusnya menjadi bahan pertimbangan manajemen bobocabin kintamani untuk dapat mengevaluasi pelayanan kalian.  terima kasih  jack."

It's not logical, why don't they have spares? & after I observed around, only the cheapest cabin didn't have an umbrella, the family cabin & hot water all had umbrellas. then I complained, saying ""all the others have umbrellas"" finally they installed an umbrella. then, I asked for insect repellent because there were so many flies there, they gave me anti-mosquito sofel. another bad thing, there were extraordinary flies there, green flies. the writing in the cabin said the flies would disappear at 5 pm, but I waited for the flies to disappear at 7 pm. the next morning I woke up, at 7 am it was already crowded with flies. really not recommended to spend time here.",4 months,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"pemandangannya bagus, service nya juga bagus sebetulnya tapi saya agak kecewa waktu saya meminta payung buat di meja depan, (waktu itu hujan) jawabannya kain payung lagi pada dicuci. enggak logis sih masa mereka enggak punya spare? & setelah saya amati sekitar, cuma cabin yang harga paling murah yang enggak dipasangin payung, yang cabin keluarga & hot water pakai payung semua. lalu saya complain, bilang ""yang lain ada payung semua"" akhirnya sama mereka baru dipasangin payung. then, saya meminta insect repellent karena disana banyak banget lalat, dikasihnya sofel anti nyamuk. bad things lainnya, disana luar biasa lalatnya, lalat ijo. tulisan di cabin bilangnya lalat akan menghilang jam 5 sore, tapi saya tungguin lalat baru hilang jam 7 malam. besok paginya saya bangun , jam 7 pagi sudah ramai lalat. sungguh sangat tidak rekomen untuk menghabiskan waktu disini."
Dinda Annisa,3.0,"Actually there are many accommodation options in this area, but in the end we decided to choose Bobocabin because the room is not a tent and there is a bathroom inside and it was recommended by a jeep tour service... Before booking, we first make sure how the road access is, according to CS the road only fits one car and if there is another car, one of them has to give in and back out, so the access problem has been resolved... we calculated that because the road is already shaded, that's why we didn't want to come here too late at night because we were afraid there wouldn't be any lights on the road. On the way here it was a bit winding but it was okay to use Raize, I can't imagine if we took a car that wasn't the type like Raize, the instructions in my opinion were OK, it wouldn't make you confused, check this and OK, you got cabin 1 which is located at the very end near the communal area... until the room was still safe, clean, the AC was functioning well, at night everything was okay... well, towards morning it seemed like there were lots of flies, after the rain there were even more flies, the tap water was turned off twice that day in the morning and afternoon, try eating breakfast outside I think it's wrong, the flies are merciful, they come into the rooms, in Jakarta they get mosquitoes, in Bali they get flies 😅 sitting in the communal area is also surrounded by flies, until they really stick, the flies confuse us, in the hot tub there are also lots of flies, on the outside table we use fishing rods Just leave the glass there, so the flies won't come into the room when the facial serum is smeared on it? There's still rubbish in the trash can outside in the morning, how come there aren't a lot of flies, breakfast is okay, choose fried rice with an egg, drink hot tea, it's okay, it's not really good, there's also a cat here, it looks like it's old, it feels like it's sick and doesn't drink enough, it's cold Also, just leave a message for those of you who want to stay here to bring a whiskey, it'll do meow 😁 but the rubbish will be thrown away and cleaned straight away...",4 months,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"sebenarnya banyak pilihan penginapan di daerah ini, tapi akhirnya memutuskan pilih bobocabin karena bentuk kamarnya yang bukan tenda dan ada kamar mandi di dalam dan rekomendasi dari jasa jeep tour..  sebelum booking, kita memakai sure dulu akses jalanannya bagaimana, menurut cs jalanan hanya muat satu mobil dan kalau ada mobil lainnya salah satu harus mengalah mundur, brt masalah akses sudah selesai..  kita hitung2 karena jalanan sudah terbayang, makanya kita kesini enggak mau terlalu malam karena takut enggak ada lampu di jalanan. di perjalanan kesini memang agak berkelok2 tapi okelah pakai raize, enggak terbayang kalo kita ambil mobil yang enggak tipe kayak raize begitu, petunjuknya menurut saya ok enggak bikin bingung, check ini dan sebagai ok, dapat kamar cabin 1 yang lokasinya diujung banget dekat komunal..  sampai kamar masih aman, bersih, ac berfungsi dengan baik, malam2 keadaan ok semua.. nah menjelang pagi baru kelihatan jadi banyak lalat, habis hujan makin banyak lalat lagi, air kran mati 2x di hari itu pagi dan sore, coba makan pagi di luar kayaknya salah, lalatnya ampun, sampai masuk2 kamar, di jakarta nepokin nyamuk, di bali nepokin lalat 😅  duduk di komunal juga dikerubutin lalat, sampai menempel banget itu lalat bingung kita, di bak mandi air panas juga banyak lalat, di meja luar kita pancing pakai gelas biar disitu saja tuh lalat enggak masuk ke kamar  masa serum wajah disemutin? tempat sampah di luar pagi2 masih ada sampahnya, bagaimana enggak banyak lalat  sarapan okelah, memilih nasi goreng pakai telor, minumnya teh panas, ya oke saja enggak enak2 banget juga  disini ada satu kucing, kayaknya sudah tua, kesian seperti sakit dan kurang minum, kedinginan pula, titip pesan saja untuk kalian yang mau menginap disini bawa whiskas ya buat sih meong 😁 tapi sampahnya langsung dibuang dan dibersihkan ya.."
Julia Ong,1.0,"honestly very very disappointed not to read google review first before booking stay at bobocabin kintamani. expectation was already very high from the beginning because many friends recommended to stay at bobocabin at least once in a lifetime. what was not taken into account is not all bobocabin will give the same experience yes :) in terms of access there, service and even the view is very very disappointing yes. I describe the experiences that I got from this place in the following points. 1. access there is very difficult. narrow & bad road. highly not recommended to bring a wide or short car. fyi, there were four of us with a lot of luggage so we were forced to use a car. if using a motorbike, still have to be careful because the road is bad & unclear. 2. bad service. this is very-very emotional to be honest. so initially we ordered this romantic dinner bundling package kintamani. really book from bobocabin & payment to bobocabin directly and for valentine's day. arrived at bobocabin immediately check-in then my friend asked about dinner later where & what time. then the staff was shocked as if they didn't know that we had ordered a bundling package. Isn't that funny? Why is that? then asked to show proof of the package order then he said ""let me ask the kitchen first"". huh? the roles weren't reversed, right? shouldn't the receptionist inform the kitchen from the start before we stayed too? emotional but still held back with the thought that it was okay as long as we still ate. we waited for the information while holding back our hunger until 7 pm then the staff came to the cabin with bad news. they couldn't provide it because usually the cook was from a third party. can you imagine being so hungry and then being told that. really annoying, I swear. then they said they would try to help us submit it to the center for a refund. they had good intentions to give compensation in the form of meat for grilling. we were also hungry, so let's go. then the meat was delivered at almost 9 am. the meat was also not fresh and without seasoning. really disappointed why our valentine's day food was like that lol even though we deliberately arranged the trip on the 14th so we could get a ""romantic dinner"" feel lol tired 3. the staff was unclear. so we wanted to take the jeep tour package to see the sunrise the next day. from the bobocabin staff (a) helped find it & got it. then for booking directly to the third party. so I contacted myself to book & make an appointment with the third party & driver (different people) to be picked up at 4 am. everything was ok. suddenly tomorrow at 2.40 am, another bobocabin staff (b) who had never chatted with me from the start, informed me that the trip was canceled because the driver was sick. nah. I was like it didn't happen. but after thinking about it I booked it myself & I had chatted with the driver to make an appointment. even if the driver was really sick why was the bobocabin staff the one who informed me. something was strange. so I chatted directly to the third party and it turned out to be true. the trip was not canceled. what bobocabin said is not true. I swear how do these people work? They can cancel people's trips at will so early in the morning. The problem is that they don't lose anything. The third party is the one who is harmed. Just imagine who the driver will come at dawn to pick up. Who is the ghost? Luckily my mind was still clear even though I was half-conscious reading the chat from the staff and then thought about chatting to confirm it myself. The only right decision I made during my stay here. Luckily I still joined the jeep tour with Bli2 who was very kind & really dedicated to his work. I can't bear it if Bli2 who is very kind is treated like this. 4. The problem with flies is really true. It's true that there are flies everywhere in the highlands, that's normal. It's just that there are so many here. I've stayed in other areas in Kintamani. There are flies everywhere but it's still not as bad as here. 5. Bonus: cockroaches get into the cabin. All the doors are tightly closed. How can there be cockroaches? there are still many more though :) btw the view is not worth it at all!!",4 months,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"jujur sangat amat kecewa enggak baca google review dulu sebelum book stay di bobocabin kintamani. ekspektasi sudah tinggi banget dari awal karena banyak banget teman-teman yang recommend untuk stay di bobocabin minimal sekali dalam seumur hidup. yang enggak diperhitungkan adalah tidak semua bobocabin bakal memberikan experience yang sama ya :) dari segi akses kesana, pelayanan bahkan view sangat sangat mengecewakan ya. saya jabarkan pengalaman2 yang saya dapatkan dari tempat ini dalam poin2 berikut.  1. akses masuk kesana susah banget. jalan sempit & jelek. sangat tidak recommend untuk bawa mobil yang lebar atau pendek. fyi, kami berempat dengan banyak bawaan jadi memang terpaksa harus pakai mobil. kalau pakai motor, tetap mesti hati-hati karena jalannya jelek & enggak jelas.  2. pelayanan buruk. ini sih sangat-sangat bikin emosi ya jujur. jadi awalnya kami pesan paket bundling dinner romantic ini kintamani. benar-benar book dari bobocabin & payment ke bobocabin langsung dan untuk valentine's day. sampai di bobocabin langsung check-ini kemudian teman saya tanya soal dinnernya nanti dimana & jam berapa begitu. lalu staffnya kaget seolah2 enggak tau kalau kami ada pesan paket bundling. lucu banget enggak sih. kok ya iso begitu. lalu meminta ditunjukin bukti pesan paket tersebut kemudian dia bilang ""saya coba tanyakan ke kitchen dulu ya"". lah? perannya enggak kebalik ya? bukannya harusnya dari resepsionis yang infokan ke kitchen dari awal sebelum kami stay juga? emosi tapi masih ditahan dengan pikiran gapapa deh asal tetap makan saja. kami tunggu infonya terus sambil menahan lapar sampai jam 7an malam baru staffnya datang ke cabin dengan kabar buruk. mereka enggak bisa provide itu karena biasa itu yang masak dari pihak ketiga. terbayang enggak sih sudah kelaperan banget terus dibilang begitu. sebel kali sumpah. lalu kata mereka akan mereka coba bantu ajukan ke pusat untuk refund. mereka ada itikad baik untuk kasih kompensasi berupa daging untuk panggang2 sih. kami juga sudah laper yaudahlah gas. terus dagingnya dianternya hampir jam 9. dagingnya juga bukan yang fresh begitu & tanpa bumbu. kecewa banget sih kok valentine's day makanan kami malah begitu wkwk padahal kan memang sengaja demi2 atur tripnya di tanggal 14 biar dapat feel ""romantic dinner""nya wkwk capek  3. staffnya enggak jelas. jadi kami mau ambil paket jeep tour untuk lihat sunrise di besokan harinya. dari staff bobocabin (a) bantu carikan & sudah dapat. kemudian untuk bookingan langsung direct ke pihak ketiga. jadi saya contact sendiri untuk booking & janjian dengan pihak ketiga & driver (beda orang) untuk dijemput jam 4 subuh. semua sudah ok. tiba-tiba besok jam 2.40 subuh, staff bobocabin lain (b) yang dari awal enggak pernah chat sama saya, infokan kalau trip dicancel karena driver sakit. lah. saya sudah kayak ya gajadi begitu. tapi setelah dipikir2 kan saya booking sendiri & saya sudah chat dengan driver untuk janjian. kalaupun driver benar-benar sakit kenapa yang info ke saya itu staff bobocabin. ada yang aneh nih. jadi saya chat langsung ke pihak ketiga dan ternyata benar. trip enggak ada dicancel. yang disampaikan pihak bobocabin itu enggak benar. sumpah ini kerjanya bagaimana sih orgnya? seenak jidatnya mau cancel2in trip orang sudah begitu subuh2 loh ini. masalahnya dia enggak rugi apa-apa. pihak ketiga yang dirugikan. bayangkan saja abang2 drivernya subuh2 datang nanti mau jemput siapa. cust ghoib? untung saja pikiran masih jernih walau setengah sadar baca chat dari staff itu lalu kepikiran untuk chat konfirmasi sendiri. satu2nya decision paling benar yang saya lakukan selama stay disini. untung tetap ikut jeep tour dengan bli2 yang sangat baik & totalitas banget kerjanya. enggak tega rasanya kalau bli2 yang baik banget itu dibeginikan.  4. masalah lalat ya benar-benar deh. memang sih dataran tinggi banyak lalat dimana mana itu wajar banget. cuma luar biasa banyak sumpah kalau disini. saya ada nginap di daerah lain di kintamani. memang lalatnya dimana mana tapi masih enggak separah disini.  5. bonus masuk kecoa ke dalam cabin ya ges ya. semua pintu tertutup rapat loh. bisa-bisanya ada kecoa  ya limit. masih banyak lagi padahal :) btw viewnya tidak worth sama sekali!!"

Maya Putri Andhini,2.0,"There are many things to review about Bobo Cabin Kintamani; 1. The access road is narrow and too extreme. 2. There are so many flies in the cabin, there might be around 5 flies inside the cabin, while there are so many flies outdoors. For me, a heavy smoker who spends more time outside, this is really uncomfortable. But, like, ""what else can I do?"" I ended up smoking while being swarmed by flies 😭 I was given an electric racket but it still wasn't worth it. The flies didn't die either. 3. The room is too small. I was a bit shocked for the price of 700k, this room is really small and I feel like I'm sleeping in a cage. It's high tech. From the scan on the door, then the windows and LEDs. But for the size of the room, it's still inhumane. The access road is difficult, when I arrive the room is small, there are so many flies. For me who dares to travel from Canggu to Kintamani by motorbike plus getting caught in the rain, this is really annoying. 4. The food and beverage service is ruined. the price is too pricey, but it is not balanced with the delicious taste. the fried rice and fried noodles are inferior to the taste of roadside restaurants which have more spices. and the cooking takes so long it can take up to an hour for just 2 menus. not to mention that my order was left behind, aka not brought along with the food because I forgot. even when ordering a mini projector you didn't notice, in the end we didn't do Netflix because we felt sorry for the waitress who kept going back and forth delivering orders to the room. 5. the only good thing about this bobocabin is the view. indeed when it comes to the view it is the champion. this doesn't need to be commented on because it is indeed good. and here the vibes are very calm, suitable for people who want to heal from depression in the office. that's all. I stayed yesterday on the 31st in cabin 15 and when checking out I heard a shout of smoking in the cabin by Hati. even though my friend and I didn't smoke in the cabin, if the smoke entered the room, we could have. because during our stay there we finished 2 packs of cigarettes ourselves. So maybe that's what makes the cabin smell like cigarettes. sorry if there are any wrong words.",5 months,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"banyak hal yang harus direview dari bobocabin kintamani ini;  1. akses jalan sempit dan terlalu ekstrem.  2. di cabin banyak banget lalat, di dalam cabin mungkin ada sekitar 5 lalat, sementara outdoor ada buanyak banget lalatnya. buat aku yang perokok berat dan lebih banyak spend waktu di luar, ini benar-benar enggak nyaman. tapi, kayak, “mau bagaimana lagi?” akhirnya ngerokok sambil digerumutin lalat😭 sudah dikasih raket setrum tetap enggak worth it. mati juga enggak itu lalat.  3. kamar terlalu kecil. aku agak shock untuk harga 700k, ini kamar kecil banget dan aku berasa kayak lagi tidur di kandang. memang sih high tech. dari scan di pintu, terus jendela dan led. tapi untuk ukuran kamarnya tetap enggak manusiawi. sudah akses jalan susah, pas sampai ruangannya kecil, banyak lalatnya. buat aku yang nekat jalan dari canggu ke kintamani naik motor plus kena hujan, ini benar-benar bikin bete banget.  4. pelayanan food and beverage hancur. harganya terlalu pricey, tapi enggak diimbangi sama rasa yang enak. nasgor sama mie gorengnya kalah sama rasa resto-resto pinggir jalan yang rasanya lebih banyak bumbunya. dan masaknya lama banget bisa sampai sejam sendiri buat 2 menu doang. belum lagi ada pesananku yang ketinggalan, alias enggak dibawa sekalian sama makanannya karena lupa. bahkan sampai pesan mini projector pun kalian enggak notice, akhirnya enggak jadi netflix-an karena kasihan sama waitressnya bolak-balik nganter pesanan ke room.  5. satu-satunya hal yang bagus di bobocabin ini ya view-nya. memang kalo soal view juara banget. ini enggak usah dikomen karena memang bagus. dan di sini vibesnya tenang banget, cocok buat orang yang mau heal dari depresi di kantor.  itu saja sih. aku yang kemarin stay tanggal 31 di cabin 15 dan pas checkout dapat teriakan merokok di dalam cabin by hati. padahal aku dan temenku enggak ada ngerokok di dalam cabin, kalau asapnya masuk ke ruangan ya kami bisa jadi. karena selama stay di sana kami ngabisin 2 bungkus rokok sendiri. jadi mungkin itu yang bikin cabin bau rokok. maaf kalau ada salah kata ya."

no reason to go there at all.  no activities. the location is too far, and the road too treacherous to go anywhere. if you don't have a vehicle, you're basically stuck. as we were.  no decent food. the property stocks popmie and soft drinks. no gofood/grab. they have food on sale but it's very basic -

Matthew Sugiarto,4.0,"came in late November 2023. In terms of room cleanliness, I got ok 👌. I could sleep peacefully too. There are indeed many flies in Kintamani, not only in the bobocabin venue. After asking a friend, he said it was because of the smell of fish near the lake. These flies come in the afternoon, but I wasn't too bothered because I focused on other things. The sunrise is great if the timing is right. The taste of the food provided is ok. 4/10. edible, but more bland. Leftover breakfast or dinner food that was ordered, even though it was taken, was still placed on the side of the road. So it became food for cats and flies. There are a lot of cats, so if you make a fuss about food that smells spread, be prepared to be approached. Yesterday I saw someone having a BBQ surrounded by cats. The journey to the place is winding and after getting close to the hill, the road is narrow, only fits 1 car so you have to take turns. There are some open areas that are a little bit narrow so when you are in a tight spot with another car, one can give way so that it can pass. Overall I enjoyed it 👌😀.",7 months,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"datang november akhir 2023. secara kebersihan kamar, saya dapat ok 👌. bisa tidur dengan tenang juga. di kintamani memang banyak lalat, bukan hanya di venue bobocabin saja. setelah tanya teman, katanya memang karena bau ikan dekat danau. lalat ini datang sore, tapi saya enggak terlalu terganggu karena fokus hal lain. sunrise nya mantab kalau waktunya pas.  rasa makanan yang disediakan termasuk ok. 4/10. bisa dimakan, tetapi lebih ke arah hambar.  makanan bekas breakfast atau dinner yang pesan, walaupun diambil, tetapi tetap diletakkan di pinggir jalan. jadi makanan kucing dan lalat. kucingnya banyak sih, jadi kalau melakukan kehebohan makanan yang baunya menyebar, siap-siap didatangi. kemarin lihat ada yang bbq pada dikerumuni kucing.  perjalanan ke tempat berkelok-kelok dan setelah dekat naik ke bukitnya, jalan sempit, hanya pas 1 mobil jadi harus bergantian. ada beberapa tanah terbuka sedikit yang ketika pas-pasan dengan mobil lain, salah satu bisa mengalah agar bisa lewat.  overall saya enjoy 👌😀."
Angelica Lapastora,2.0,"me and my friends (4 ini total) stayed here, and damn. we left 2 days before our supposedly check-out date. the room is small and can barely move inside. the light inside is spoiled, it turns on and off without us controlling it and the controller isn't much of a help. the road that leads to this place is very narrow, rocky and steep, it's so hard to get here. it was a challenge for us because most of us are used to drive on concrete roads. they also provide fnb but expect it to be exp. about 65k per meal. actually, they gave the breakfast for free starting on the third day. we were wondering why. one thing to note also is the flies infestation. there is a reminder inside the room saying that they usually appear during daytime and its true. we requested for a mosquito net, but they gave the one with big holes. not really much of a help.  the only thing good here is the view and its access to mt. batur.  ini summary, this place is good for couples and a group who wants to stay here for a couple of days. cannot recommend this for a wig-long stay. who knows? you might end up like us.",7 months,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"me and my friends (4 ini total) stayed here, and damn. we left 2 days before our supposedly check-out date. the room is small and can barely move inside. the light inside is spoiled, it turns on and off without us controlling it and the controller isn't much of a help. the road that leads to this place is very narrow, rocky and steep, it's so hard to get here. it was a challenge for us because most of us are used to drive on concrete roads. they also provide fnb but expect it to be exp. about 65k per meal. actually, they gave the breakfast for free starting on the third day. we were wondering why. one thing to note also is the flies infestation. there is a reminder inside the room saying that they usually appear during daytime and its true. we requested for a mosquito net, but they gave the one with big holes. not really much of a help.  the only thing good here is the view and its access to mt. batur.  ini summary, this place is good for couples and a group who wants to stay here for a couple of days. cannot recommend this for a wig-long stay. who knows? you might end up like us."

archieliev,3.0,"I really appreciate it when all the staff worked hard at that time. I was also very happy with the view that I enjoyed quite a bit at the location, but of course what are some inputs that I would like to convey: 1. Please for the staff, whether it's a different department or from bobocabin, they have the same product knowledge. As simple as the total price of the food ordered, they at least know so that it's not like when I stayed (May 10-11) the waitress who brought it said the total was 60 thousand, but when I checked out I was asked to pay the rest, it turned out the actual amount was 13 thousand. maybe that's a small thing, and I'm still safe, but if this happens to someone else and the amount is not small, they could get angry or complain. 2. I ordered fried rice and the rice was cold, besides that the spoon and fork were forgotten by the staff, so the food finally came but I had to wait again to eat. please make sure everything is complete before bringing it. 3. Product knowledge about several facilities, even though they are different departments, it is also important to know. for example regarding public kitchen facilities, I asked the staff who were milling around but they didn't know and were confused about answering. 4. For call service, there may also be a voice or telephone version. Because I feel that through chat there is a sense of uncertainty whether my message has been read or not. (There is indeed a read feature, but at that time my message looked unread, and I know that there is more than one staff member, but what I discussed was that I wanted certainty that the message was received, not asking the staff to reply quickly) Indeed, the officer came immediately at that time, but because there was no confirmation of entry, I thought that the officer would not definitely come or not. 5. Please pay attention to some electronic maintenance. Like the blur mode had an error, and the air conditioner in the room wouldn't turn on, let alone cool. I was hot for a few minutes inside and finally decided to stay outside for a while. 6. My expectations are quite high here, because of the price range and also the views offered. I hope to improve what I have said. If the problem of insects and slugs cannot be controlled, but in my opinion the above are things that management can improve. I like the view I get, but unfortunately the food, staff knowledge and also some of the shortcomings above, make me think twice about coming back there or not :).",a year,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"saya sangat mengapresiasi apabila keseluruhan staf sudah bekerja keras pada saat itu. saya juga sangat senang dengan pemandangan yang cukup saya nikmati dilokasi, namun tentunya apa beberapa masukan yang ingin saya sampaikan:  1. mohon untuk para staf entah itu beda departemen asal memang dari bobocabin mereka memiliki product knowledge yang sama. sesederhana soal total harga makanan yang dipesan, mereka setidaknya tahu sehingga tidak seperti waktu saya menginap (10-11 mei) waitress yang membawakan bilang total 60rb, namun ketika checkout saya diminta membayar sisanya ternyata jumlah sesungguhnya adalah 13rb. mungkin itu hal kecil ya, dan saya masih aman, namun apabila ini terjadi pada pihak lain dan jumlahnya tidak sedikit, bisa saja mereka marah atau complain.  2. saya memesan nasi goreng dan nasinya dingin, disamping itu sendok dan garpu lupa dibawa oleh staf yang akhirnya makanan datang tapi saya harus menunggu lagi untuk makan. mohon pastikan semuanya lengkap sebelum dibawa.  3. product knowledge mengenai beberapa fasilitas walaupun beda departemen, hal itu penting juga diketahui. contoh perihal fasilitas dapur umum, saya bertanya ke staf yang bersliweran namun mereka tidak tau dan kebingungan menjawab.  4. untuk call service mungkin juga ada versi suara atau telp. karena saya merasa melalui chat ada rasa ketidakpastian apakah pesan saya sudah dibaca atau belum. (memang ada fitur read, tapi kondisi saat itu peaan saya terlihat belum dibaca, dan saya tau staf pekerjaannya bukan hanya satu, tapi yang saya bahas adalah saya ingin kepastian bahwa pesan diterima, bukan meminta staf menbalas cepat) memang petugas langsung datang saat itu, tapi karena belum ada konfirmasi masuk jadi saya berpikir bahwa petugas tidak pasti akan datang atau tidak.  5. mohon perhatikan beberapa maintenance elektronik. seperti mode blur sempat error, dan ac dikamar tidak mau menyala apalagi dingin. saya kepanasan beberapa menit didalam dan akhirnya memutuskan stay diluar beberapa saat.  6. ekspektasi saya cukup tinggi disini, karena kisaran harga dan juga pemandangan yang ditawarkan. saya harap bisa mengimprove apa yang sudah saya sampaikan. kalau masalah serangga dan slug itu tidak bisa dikontrol, tapi hal diatas menurut saya hal yang bisa management tingkatkan. saya suka view yang didapat, namun sayang makanan, pengetahuan staf dan juga beberapa kekurangan diatas tadi, membuat saya berpikir dua kali untuk  datang kembali kesana atau tidak :)."

Don Donny,4.0,"highly recommended: 1. bring a jacket / warm clothes. 2. prepare adequate hiking equipment, because the hotel facilities are quite close to Mount Batur not recommended: 1. drive at night, especially following the route suggested by Google Maps. the route is quite steep (average gradients 20% up) & steep. 2. bring a vehicle that is not in prime condition. 3. invite an inexperienced driver. plus (+) 1. the facilities are clean. 2. friendly & helpful staff. 3. favorite spot is at the end of this facility can see 360 ​​degrees of the Kintamani area. minus (-) 1. access to the parking road to the cabin is quite troublesome, because there is no ramp for suitcase users. 2. especially the car park, lots of gravel. conclusion: recommended especially for nature lovers & challenge lovers.",a year,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"sangat disarankan: 1. membawa jacket / pakaian hangat. 2. mempersiapkan peralatan hiking yang memadai, karena fasilitas hotel ini cukup dekat dengan gunung batur  tidak disarankan: 1. mengemudi diwaktu malam, apalagi mengikuti rute yang disarankan google map. rute cukup curam (rata rata gradients 20% up) & terjal. 2. membawa kendaraan yang tidak prima. 3. mengajak pengemudi yang kurang berpengalaman.  plus (+) 1. fasilitas nya bersih. 2. staff yang ramah & suka membantu. 3. spot favorite ada di ujung fasilitas ini bisa melihat 360 derajat kawasan kintamani.  minus (-) 1. akses jalan parkir menuju kabin cukup menyusahkan, karena tidak ada jalan landai bagi pengguna koper. 2. terutama parkiran mobil, banyak kerikil.  kesimpulan: direkomendasikan terutama bagi penyuka wisata alam & penyuka tantangan."

I saw the previous reviews too, meaning there was no attempt to fix it.. huff... oh yeah, my room had a broken insect repellent door that almost drowned my child.. the floor was cracked and one more thing that was surprising. I didn't get breakfast. It was indeed in a state from the start. But I saw other glamping that had breakfast and a hot water pool too.",a year,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"aduh menyesal banget staycation disini karena ternyata banyak yang lebih bagus lebih murah dan lebih layak dari ini.aku pesan hot tub nomor kamar 1, eh percuma mahal2 enggak bisa kepake ..ternyata enggak cuma saya .lihat review2 sebelum-sebelumnya juga begitu, berarti enggak ada upaya perbaikan..huff...oiya kamar saya nya dapat pintu anti serangga yang rusak hampir nibanin anak aku..lantainya retak dan satu hal juga nih yang bikin heran .enggak dapat sarapan.memang sih sudah di state dari awal.tapi lihat glamping yang lain dapat sarapan  dan ada pool air anget pula."

Helen T.,5.0,"First time staying at Bobocabin (Kintamani) and it was really fun! The view can be good (pod 11), especially the pod cabin which has large windows, making it even more aesthetic!  Here, 1 cabin can sleep 2 people, it already has: - bathroom + hot water! - soap & shampoo provided so no need - bother bringing more soap - 2 bottles of drinking water - electric kettle, tea and cups - super duper comfortable blankets, especially if the night temperature can be 16 - 18° really - super cool, facilities like pad that can play with the window so it can be blurred (so you can't see anything from inside/outside) + speaker and bluetooth connection so you can play songs on the pod! really cool, love this so much - communal kitchen available - lots of spots to light a bonfire too - there is a hairdryer additional facilities that have their own charges: - bonfire (firewood 35.0, can order corn, marshmallows with their own fees) - dinner/ breakfast/snack (for ordering food it seems to be according to the time. If you want breakfast, the menu is only available for breakfast, so you can't order from the menu with dinner/bonfire time) notes: 1. When traveling to bobocabin, please pay attention to the signage (if you find a sign It says ""bobocabin 1.5 kamu"", be prepared after traveling 1.5 kamu, pay attention to the bobocabin & sunrise hill camp sign on the left (the pole is quite high) so you don't miss it, because if you follow Google Maps you will end up going into a narrow back lane and still chaotic 2. yes, the bush fly problem is super big from morning to evening. because kintamani plantation uses compost fertilizer, causing so many flies! it's so bad that they even get into cars. 3. The temperature at night reaches 16 - 18°, you really have to bring a jacket/sweater/hoodie. Jakartans who are strong in the cold like me, can't stand the shivering at night when they go out of the pod 😝 4. From morning after sunrise until noon, the temperature will be blazing hot, because the pod has a large window, so the pod inside is exposed to direct sunlight and inside the post it gets hot to the point that even the AC fails. 5. Check-in facilities are self-check-out, everything uses the bobobox application (from adjusting the pod lights, locking it). doors, blur windows, chat admin/host to order food/other needs, see the food menu) 6. If you order food, chat to the host and must pay first (there is a qris barcode in each pod), after paying, the food will be processed. enjoy my stay at bobocabin! the view is really nice, you can directly see lake batur, trunyan village, and mount abang. that's all.",a year,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"pertama kali nginep di bobocabin (kintamani) dan asik banget! viewnya dapat bagus (pod 11), apalagi pod cabin yang ada jendela guede, bikin makin aesthetic!  disini 1 cabin bisa untuk 2 orang, sudah ada : - kamar mandi + air panas! - disediakan sabun & shampoo jadi enggak perlu - repot-repot bawa sabun lagi - air minum 2 botol - kettle listrik, teh dan cangkir - selimut super duper nyaman, apalagi kalau malam suhu bisa 16 - 18°sih - yang super keren, fasilitas seperti pad yang bisa mainin jendelanya biar bisa di blur (jadi dari dalam/luar enggak kelihatan apa-apa) + speaker dan koneksi bluetooth jadi bisa setel lagu di pod! cool habis, love this so much - communal kitchen available - banyak spot spot untuk nyalain bonfire juga - ada hairdryer  fasilitas tambahan yang ada charge tersendiri : - bonfire (kayu bakar 35.0, bisa pesan jagung, marshmallow dengan fee masing-masing) - dinner/breakfast/snack (untuk pemesanan makanan sepertinya sesuai dengan waktu. kalau mau breakfast, menunya hanya tersedia khusus breakfast, jadi enggak bisa pesan di menu dengan waktu dinner/bonfirenya)  notes : 1. ketika perjalanan menuju bobocabin, harap perhatikan signage (kalau ketemu sign bertuliskan ""bobocabin 1,5 kamu"", siap2 setelah menempuh 1,5 kamu tersebut perhatikan sign bobocabin & sunrise hill camp di sebelah kiri (agak tinggi tiangnya) biar enggak kelewatan, karena kalo mengikuti google maps bakal mblusuk mblusuk ke jalur belakang yang sempit dan masih amburadul  2. yes, the bush fly problem yang super banyak dari pagi-sore. karena perkebunan kintamani pakai pupuk kompos, nyebabin banyak banget laletnya! enggak karuan sampai masuk2 mobil.  3. suhu malam hari mencapai 16 - 18°sih, kudu banget bawa jaket/sweater/hoodie. orang jakarta yang kuat dingin saja kayak saya, enggak tahan sampai menggigil malem2 keluar pod 😝  4. dari pagi setelah sunrise sampai siang, suhunya bakal jadi panas terik, karena pod ada jendela besar, jadi pod di dalam kena matahari langsung dan di dalam pos jadi panas sampai ac pun kalah  5. fasilitas check-ini check-out yang mandiri, semua serba pakai aplikasi bobobox (dari atur lampu pod, kunci pintu, blur jendela, chat admin/host untuk pesan makanan/keperluan lainnya, lihat menu makanan)  6. kalau pesan makanan, chat ke host dan kudu bayar dahulu (ada qris barcode di tiap pod), setelah bayar baru deh makanan di proses.  enjoy deh saya stay di bobocabin! bagus banget viewnya bisa langsung lihat danau batur, desa trunyan, dan gunung abang.  sekian."

Putri Rachmawati,2.0,"bobo cabin kintamani service: good, friendly okay location: nice view but lots of flies, and flies appear from morning and above 5 o'clock then start to decrease and disappear at night, it is very unfortunate that bobocabin has no effort to reduce the flies, I understand bobo cabin is committed to maintaining a natural environment, but this is really a lot, and what about the comfort and health of visitors, it is even more difficult because of the many flies, there are flies in the communal room, room: for the size I really understand if the room is small, I'm just confused about this bobocabin, has anyone tried to stay in your room? because your room is already soooooo hot at 9am, the AC is already on 17, it doesn't help at all, try to think about how to prevent the heat from being absorbed, such as choosing a paint color, black, why black, black absorbs heat, I often camp alone, I set up a tent, that's all, during the day it's not as hot as in the Bobo Cabin, and before I left the Bobo Cabin I went glamping in Menjangan, it was really not hot during the day, please help, this is very uncomfortable, it's hot inside, there are lots of flies outside",a year,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"bobo cabin kintamani service: baik, ramah oke lokasi : pemandangan bagus cuma banyak banget laler, dan laler muncul dari pagi dan jm 5 keatas baru mulai berkurang dan malam hilang, sangat disayangkan dari pihak bobocabin enggak ada usaha untuk mengurangi lalat2 tersebut,, saya mengerti bobo cabin ada komitmen menjaga lingkungan tetap alami, tapi ini benar-benar banyaaak sekali, dan bagiman dengan kenyamanan dan kesehatan pengunjung, untuk makin susah karena banyak lalat, di dalam ruang komunal pun ada lalat, ruangan: untuk ukuran saya sangat mengerti kalo ruangan kecil, cuma saya bingung ini pihak bobocabin apa ada yang sudah mencoba untuk stay diruangan kalian? karena ruangan kalian untuk jam 9 pagi saja sudah puaaaanaaaas sekali,, ac sudah 17 tidak membantu sama sekali,, coba kalian pikir bagimna cara nya agar panas tidak menyerap, seperti pemilihan warna cat, hitam,, kenapa hitam, hitam menyerap panas,, saya sering camping sendiri, mndiri kan tenda,, itu saja siang hari nya tidak sepanas di cabin bobo cabin, dan sebelum dari bobo cabin saya habis glamping di menjangan, itu sangat-sangat tidak panas di siang hari,, tolong ya ini snagat tidak nyaman, di dalam panas, di luar banyak lalat"
Kopi Biring,3.0,the price is quite pricy for the service you get. the AC is not felt during the day because it is always exposed to the sun and the material used absorbs heat. the technology used that makes my child happy is opening the door using a cellphone (barcode) darkening the window glass (blur) with a pad from bobocabin. can play the sound of a river or forest. for a new experience it's okay.,a year,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,harganya cukup pricy untuk service yang di dapat. ac nya jadi tidak terasa pada siang hari karena selalu terpapar matahari dan material yang digunakan menyerap panas. teknologi yang digunakan yang membuat anak saya senang karena membuka pintu menggunakan handphone (barcode) menggelapkan kaca jendela (blur) dengan pad dari bobocabin. dapat memutar suara sungai atau hutan. untuk new experience boleh lah.

Aulia Rahman,4.0,"I stayed for two nights at bobocabin. and it's a worthy experience. the view is amazing, cool, calm, romantic. from the cabin you can see the view of Lake Batur and the houses of the residents. at night the atmosphere is dark and dim inviting the mode to crush. disclaimer: september is the coldest time; rain accompanied by thick fog, december is the most extreme time; hot from 9 am to noon (even the air conditioner can't fight it), and starts to get cold again around 4 pm until the next morning. unfortunately I stayed in december lol. but tbf on average mountains that are close to the lake tend to have hot weather during the day, cold at night. for example ranau (ranau pride here) cabin in a cabin with an area of ​​approximately 6x6 I got two mineral water brand aqua in glass bottles. I myself was amazed because usually accommodation generally provides mineral water in plastic bottles. next there is air conditioning, kettle water heater, hair dryer, soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and a box containing toothbrushes for two people. under the mattress there are two compartments for storing luggage because there is no closet, there are only four hangers for hanging clothes (no hangers.) oh one more attraction of this cabin is the touchscreen control panel that can connect to bluetooth, adjust the lights (light brightness and light color) and can adjust the large cabin windows to blur and unblur. for more details please see for yourself in the photos scattered on the internet and tiktok videos. so the room you occupy seems small but compact and neat. because the inn is close to the residents' plantations, that's why there are lots of flies. but in the cabin an electric baygon is provided even though it doesn't really help [insert bart simpson at least you've tried meme here]. the glass separating the shower room leaks out, so the shower splashes still escape but no big deal i think, after all a foot cloth has been provided. the mattress is a typical futon, not a hotel-style spring bed. well, it's called a cabin. my notes for the future: - hopefully sandals and a comb are provided for amenities - hopefully the shower water heater can be adjusted to the level of heat - the touchscreen control panel is fixed again. I happened to get a cabin with a control panel that often had problems. The blur unblur function and the lights often jammed. Then the Bluetooth function often had problems. Hopefully it will be considered and fixed in the future. The location for the access road I describe as two: the main road and the road to the inn. The main road is a winding asphalt road up and down typical of Ubud Kintamani. Well, the access road to the inn is quite steep because the inn is located on a hilltop and is only wide enough for one car. If I give an idea, it's like a motocross road, or a plantation road. For those who come by motorbike, you need a motorbike with strong traction and gas to be able to easily go up there. Then at night it's quite dark, so my advice if you want to buy something at a minimarket, for example sanitary napkins or cotton, it's better to do it and finish it when the sun is shining so you don't have to go back and forth because the road is not easy to pass. And the distance is about 10 minutes from the inn. Let's use a wrap. in my opinion, this is a suitable place for family bonding gathering (if you have a crush, you can play mode here. mestakung), or a vacation with a partner who wants to get away from the hustle and bustle of the world. overall 7.5/10 pas: before coming and staying here, install the bobobox app. it helps a lot. oh one more thing, there are 3 cute cats with poor eyes. usually they come in the morning and afternoon. we bought cat food at this minimarket to feed them.",a year,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"saya menginap selama dua malam di bobocabin. and it's a worthy experience. viewnya luar biasa, dingin tenang romantis. dari kabin pun bisa melihat pemandangan danau batur dan rumah penduduk. di saat malam suasananya gelap temaram mengundang modus ke gebetan. disclaimer: september adalah waktu terdingin; hujan disertai kabut tebal, desember adalah waktu terekstrim; panas dari jam 9 sampai siang (bahkan ac enggak kelawan), dan mulai dingin lagi sekitar jam 4 sore hingga esok paginya. sialnya saya menginap di bulan desember lol. but tbf rata rata gunung yang dekat dengan danau cenderung cuacanya panas pas siang, dingin di malam hari. contohnya ranau (ranau pride here)  cabin di kabin dengan luas kurang lebih 6x6 saya mendapat dua air mineral merk aqua berbotol kaca. saya sendiri takjub karena biasanya penginapan pada umumnya menyediakan air mineral dengan kemasan botol plastik. next terdapat ac, ceret water heater, hair dryer, sabun, sampo, odol, dan kotak berisi sikat gigi untuk dua orang. di bawah kasur terdapat dua kompartemen untuk menyimpan barang bawaan dikarenakan tidak terdapat lemari, hanya ada empat cantelan untuk menggantung pakaian (tidak ada hanger.) oh satu lagi daya tarik dari kabin ini adalah control panel touchscreen yang bisa koneksi bluetooth, mengatur lampu (keterangan lampu dan warna lampu) dan bisa mengatur jendela besar kabin untuk blur dan unblur. jelasnya silakan anda lihat sendiri di foto foto yang bertebaran di internet dan video tiktok. jadi ruangan yang ditempati kesannya kecil namun compact nan apik. karena penginapannya dekat dengan perkebunan penduduk, makanya banyak lalat. tapi di kabin disediakan baygon elektrik walaupun tidak terlalu membantu [insert bart simpson at least you've tried meme here]. kaca pembatas ruang showernya leakout, jadi percikan shower masih lolos ke luar but no big deal i think, toh sudah disediain lap kaki. kasurnya tipikal futon, bukan springbed ala hotel. well, namanya juga kabin. catatan saya ke depannya: - semoga disediakan sandal dan sisir untuk amenities - semoga shower water heaternya bisa diatur tingkat kepanasannya - control panel touchscreennya diperbaki lagi ya. kebetulan saya dapat cabin dengan control panel yang suka kumat-kumatan. fungsi blur unblur dan lampu suka macet. lalu fungsi bluetooth nya suka bermasalah. semoga diperhatikan dan diperbaiki ke depannya.  lokasi untuk jalan akses saya deskripsikan jadi dua: jalan utama dan jalan ke penginapan. jalan utama adalah jalan aspal berkelok naik turun khas ubud kintamani. nah, akses jalan ke arah penginapan cukup curam karena letak penginapannya agak di puncak bukit dan lebarnya muat cuma satu mobil. kalo saya kasih bayangan kayak jalanan motorcross, atau jalan perkebunan. bagi yang datangnya pakai motor, perlu motor yang tarikan dan gas yang kuat untuk bisa mudah naik ke sana. lalu pada malam hari cukup gelap, jadi saran saya kalau anda mau membeli sesuatu di minimarket misalkan pembalut atau kapas, lebih baik lakukan dan tuntaskan di saat matahari bersinar biar enggak bolak balik karena memang jalannya itu bukan terbilang mudah dilalui. dan jaraknya kira kira 10 menit dari penginapan.  let's memakai a wrap. sepengamatan saya, ini tempat yang cocok untuk gathering yang sifatnya family bonding (if lu have crush, lu can modus modus here. mestakung), atau liburan bersama pasangan yang ingin menepi dari hingar bingar dunia.  overall 7.5/10  pas: sebelum datang dan menginap di sini, install apps bobobox. it helps a lot. oh one more thing, there are 3 cute cats with poor eyes. usually they come at morning and afternoon. we bought cat food ini minimarket to feed them."

ricky tanujaya,4.0,"a really good glamping concept accommodation. clean, complete facilities, the best view. the first thing that needs to be fixed is the access road to the location. this is really bad. only fits 1 car, the road is damaged. there should be 1 officer above and 1 officer below to coordinate the car going up/down so that no one passes each other in the middle. then the food. I ordered fried rice for dinner. it tastes messy. but yeah what can I do, I'm already hungry and really thinking about going down to find food outside. there are so many flies here and it's annoying. I'm just wondering how there can be so many flies on a mountain like this.",a year,Bobocabin Kintamani Bali,"penginapan dengan konsep glamping yang oke banget. bersih, fasilitas lengkap, view the best. hal yang perlu diperbaiki pertama dari akses jalan ke lokasi. ini enggak banget sih. cuma muat 1 mobil, jalan rusak. mestinya ada 1 petugas diatas dan 1 petugas dibawah untuk koordinasi mobil naik/turun jadi biar enggak ada yang papasan ditengah-tengah. kemudian makanan. saya pesan nasi goreng untuk dinner. rasanya berantakan. tapi  ya apa boleh buat sudah lapar dan mikir banget untuk turun cari makan diluar. lalat disini banyak banget dan bikin annoying. agak wondering saja sih diatas gunung begini kok bisa lalatnya seabrek."

Harry,4.0,"location right on the beach, sea view with the sound of roaring waves. the location is hidden with a private beach. the distance between the cabins is quite far, with large glass windows facing the sea. glass with a sophisticated system can be blurred with the application. there are glass windows on the side and top too. so you can see the night sky. the lights use like large led striplights that can be controlled from the bobocabin application or tablet in the cabin equipped with speakers that have built-in river or wave sound settings. the room is quite clean, but there are insects, maybe because the windows and doors are not tight enough. the air conditioner doesn't seem cold enough and there are water droplets. in the lobby the receptionist sells snacks, drinks and food that can be heated.",a month,Bobocabin Madasari Pangandaran,"lokasi persis pinggir pantai, pemandangan laut dengan suara ombak yang menderu deru. lokasi nya tersembunyi dengan pantai private.  jarak antara kabin lumayan jauh, dengan kaca jendela besar yang menghadap laut. kaca dengan sistem canggih bisa bikin blur dengan aplikasi. ada jendela kaca di bagian samping dan atas juga. jadi bisa lihat langit malam. lampunya pakai kayak led striplight yang besar bisa dikontrol dari aplikasi bobocabin atau tablet yang ada di kabin dilengkapi speaker yang ada pengaturan bawaan suara sungai atau ombak.  kamar lumayan bersih, tapi ada serangga, mungkin karena kurang rapat di jendela dan pintunya. ac kayak kurang dingin dan ada tetesan air.  di lobby respsionisnya ada jual snack, minuman dan makanan rte tinggal dipanasin."

Ressy Susanti,5.0,"The first bobocabin that I tried, the place is very nice to relax, because it is far from the hustle and bustle of the Pangandaran beach, there is our own private beach, so we can play on a quiet beach, there are not many visitors, only fellow visitors of the bobocabin, we booked a deluxe cabin, not too spacious, 1 queen size bed, bathroom in the house but still enough for 2 adults and 2 small children. we arrived at the location at less than 4 p.m., when we arrived at the info cabin, we were a bit nagging a little bit, because it was long past the check-in time and the time was still not ready, finally at the info there was a cabin that was ready, we waited for about 15 minutes. the location of the cabin is on the cliff, it's a mistake to use a super large suitcase, it's very heavy because the access is all stairs, so the suitcase must be lifted up to the top, fortunately the staff wants to help us carry our suitcases, don't forget to tip us for the food menu, room service can only be ordered until the clock .5 pm . breakfast is available for 2 pax, you can choose the menu, and you can buy additional menu items as well as breakfast in front of the cabin, so the food is delivered to our cabin when it's ready, oia, the downside of breakfast is that you can only get nasgor and fruit, not even given a drink at all, even though it should can be given mineral water in a glass just like that. so far I'm quite satisfied staying here, the view from the cabin where we stayed is also very nice, right at the sea, the window can be set on off, also staying at the bobocabin, it's mandatory to download the bobobox application, because all our access is using the application, unlocking, chatting with staff, ordering food, light and window settings in the cabin, even check out through the application",a month,Bobocabin Madasari Pangandaran,"bobocabin pertama yang dicoba, tempatnya enak banget buat relax, karena jauh dari hiruk pikuk keramaian pantai pangandaran ada private beach sendiri, jadi kita bisa main di pantai yang sepi enggak banyak pengunjung cuma sesama pangunjung bobocabin saja kita pesan deluxe cabin, enggak terlalu luas, 1 kasur queen size, kamar mandi di dalem tapi masih cukup buat 2dewasa 2anak kecil . kita sampai di lokasi jam.4 kurang, pas di info cabin kita belum siap agak ngomel dikit, karena kan sudah lewat lama dari jam check ini masa masih belum siap, akhirnya di info ada cabin yang sudah ready, menunggu sekitar 15menit . lokasi cabin ada diatas tebing, salah banget pakai koper super gede, berat banget karena aksesnya tangga semua jadi koper wajib diangkat sampai ke atas untung staff nya mau bantuin bawa koper kita, jangan lupa kasih tip untuk menu makanan, room service cuma bisa dipesan sampai jam.5 sore . sarapan dapat 2pax, bisa pilih menu, dan bisa beli tambahan menu makanan lain juga sarapan di depan cabin, jadi makanan diantar ke cabin kita saat sudah ready oia, minusnya sarapan cuma dapat nasgor dan buah saja, bahkan tanpa dikasih minum sama sekali, padahal harusnya bisa lah dikasih air mineral yang di gelas saja begitu . so far cukup puas nginep disini view dari cabin tempat kita nginep juga bagus banget langsung laut lepas jendelanya bisa di setting on off juga nginep di bobocabin wajib download aplikasi bobobox, karena semua akses kita pakai aplikasi itu, buka kunci, chat staff, pesan makanan, setting lampu dan jendela dalam cabin, bahkan check out pun lewat aplikasi"

Arsan Dwi Hamong Mukti,5.0,"the best place for healing indeed! quiet, peaceful, warm, waves crashing, bird sounds, truly an extraordinary place to escape from the stress of routine. the place is truly hidden, feels like having a private beach. access from the side of the road is quite steep, only a footpath is made for 1 lane cars, so if you pass on the incline when entering it is a bit scary to reverse. but it all pays off when you enter the inner area and the lobby. awesome! for standard rooms and services like bobobox/bobocabin others, food ordering service is also available but must be ordered a few hours before 4 pm for dinner or before 8 pm for breakfast the next morning. staying here will definitely get sunrise especially in the summer it is always bright like now. basically if there is fortune, I will definitely come back to this place. oh yes if you bring your parents, make sure to order a family room or a room closest to the lobby reception, because the executive and deluxe rooms are on a cliff and have to climb quite high stairs.",9 months,Bobocabin Madasari Pangandaran,"tempat terbaik buat healing memang!  sunyi, sepi, hangat, debur ombak, suara burung, benar-benar tempat luar biasa buat kabur dari penatnya rutinitas.  tempatnya benar-benar tersembunyi, serasa punya pantai private. akses dari pinggir jalan lumayan curam, hanya dibuat jalan setapak untuk mobil 1 jalur, jadi kalau papasan di tanjakan ketika masuk agak ngeri untuk mundur2nya. tapi semua terbayarkan ketika sudah masuk ke area dalam dan lobby nya. mantul!  untuk kamar dan pelayanan standar seperti bobobox/bobocabin lainnya, layanan pesan makanan juga ada cuma harus di pesan beberapa jam sebelum jam 4 sore untuk dinner atau sebelum jam 8 malam untuk sarapan besok paginya. nginep disini pasti dapat sunrise apalagi di musim panas selalu cerah seperti sekarang ini. pokoknya kalau ada rejeki pasti balik lagi ke tempat ini.  oh ya kalau bawa orang tua, pastikan pesan yang family room atau room yang paling dekat dengan lobby reception, karena room yang executive dan deluxe ada di atas tebing dan harus naik anak tangga yang lumayan tinggi."

Syaifur R,5.0,"first time staying here, didn't expect the room to be nice. really like in a hotel, even though from the outside it looks like it will be ordinary. then the order is also delivered to each cabin. as for the view, there is no need to doubt it. it's just that the application often bugs and needs improvement.",a month,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"pertama kali menginap disini, enggak menyangka ternyata bagus kamarnya. benar-benar seperti di hotel, padahal dari luar kayaknya bakalan biasa saja. terus pesanan juga diantarkan ke kabin masing-masing. kalau untuk pemandangan tidak usah diragukan lagi. hanya saja aplikasinya sering ng'bug butuh perbaikan."

Faishal Iman,5.0,"highly recommended here. suitable for those who are stressed and need time alone. to relieve anxiety is also good. delicious menu, quite expensive and taste 4 star breakfast using catering rice, quite delicious 4 star get boxed rice, hot tea, bottled water. for the bbq, the portion is not much with a fairly expensive price. but all that needs to be considered and thought about again. considering its location on a mountain slope, it will be difficult to get what is on the menu. hotel in the middle of the forest.",2 months,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"recomend banget kesini. cocok buat yang lagi strees dan butuh waktu sendiri. buat menghilangkan galau juga enak.  menu enak, cukup mahal dan rasa 4 star breakfast pakai nasi cathring, lumayan enak 4 star  dapat nasi kotak, teh hangat, air putih kemasan.  buat bbq.nya, kurang banyak porsinya dengan harga yang cukup mahal.  tapi semua itu perlu dipertimbangkan dan di fikirkan lagi. mengingat lokasinya di lereng gunung, akan sulit mendapatkan yang ada di menu.  hotel ditengah hutan."

Adelia P,3.0,"It's easy to come early, the place is good, the concept is ok smart room but there is no TV, it's perfect for looking for peace because of the location in the countryside. but omg the breakfast is not great, the food is taken and limited, the menu really doesn't appreciate the samsek where the rice is hard, there is only the main meal, there is no dessert or fruit, the drinks are only infused water and hot water only.",2 months,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"pas awal datang senang sih tempatnya bagus konsepnya ok smart room begitu tapi enggak ada tv, cocok banget buat cari ketenangan karena lokasi dialam. tapi omg breakfastnya enggak banget, makananya diambilin dan dibatasin, benar-benar menunya enggak menghargai samsek mana nasinya keras, cuma ada makan utama enggak ada dessert maupun buah, minuman juga cuma ada infused water sama air panas saja."
Angga Indrawan Fauzi,5.0,"in terms of location and road conditions are quite extreme, hills, up and down, the incline is quite steep (I happened to pass through the Ampel ravine). Suggestion if you go there, avoid traveling at night. then for the super humble service of the employees. then for the standard cabin room only, AC, hot water, which makes the natural atmosphere unique, so the room adjusts to the natural concept, already equipped with several technologies in each room. overall satisfied staying here.",2 months,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"dari segi lokasi dan kondisi jalan cukup extreme, perbukitan, naik turun, tanjakannya cukup terjal (kebetulan aku lewat jurang ampel). saran kalo kesana perjalanan hindari waktu malam. terus untuk pelayanan super humble pegawai2nya. lalu untuk kamar standard cabin saja sih, ac, air panas, yang bikin unik suasana alam, jadi kamar menyesuaikan konsep alam, sudah disertai beberapa teknologi di setiap kamarnya. overall puas nginep disini."
Auzan Ban,3.0,"The place is okay, but there are lots of mosquitoes. If you bring small children, you have to bring lotion.

Merry Sipin,2.0,"I arrived at 14.00 but couldn't check in yet, I waited until 15.00 for the room to be ready. The sheets seemed like they weren't changed for each new guest, so they weren't fresh from the previous guest. The position of the AC was wrong so it was very hot during the day.

Royals Capital,3.0,"if the goal is to find fresh mountain air among the trees, it is recommended. can you reach here? enjoy the sound of nature, bbq and breakfast pay again, bonfire pay again. if you bring children, it is not recommended because what do they want to play, in the end they look at their cellphones. small rooms are typical of glamping, there is no view. the concept room is cool, the lights can change colors, the glass can change into ice glass, you can also choose bird sounds from the available music player. there is a water heater, there is air conditioning, complete amenities. with the same price you can get a star hotel, but something different and new experience. just try it once.",11 months,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"kalau tujuannya mencari udara segar pegunungan diantara pepohonan, recommended. bisa mengapai saja disini? nikmati suara alam, bbq dan breakfast bayar lagi, api unggun bayar lagi.  kalau bawa anak, kurang recommend karena mau main apa mereka, ujung-ujung nya lihat hp.  kamar kecil khas glamping, view enggak ada. asik sih concept room nya, lampu nya bisa berubah2 warna, kaca nya bisa berubah jadi ice glass, bisa pilih suara burung juga dari player music yang tersedia.  water heater ada, ac ada, amenities lengkap.  dengan harga yang sama bisa dapat hotel berbintang sih, tapi something different and new experience. coba cukup sekali saja."

Dav Don,5.0,"for access road from the tourist ticket office the road is quite good but after entering towards bobacabin the road is badly damaged and needs to be repaired because the holes are quite deep, I got a cabin in the middle if I took a straight road it turned out to be far better to take the side road which is more gentle and close to the complete room facilities but for my large size the toilet/wc feels small for yesterday's food there were many that were not there so I chose to go out to eat well here the entrance ticket for the tourist attraction should not be thrown away because if you are going to go back in you will be asked tea time in the afternoon feels comfortable and calm with the choices available when enjoyed on the balcony with fog (although it is a bit expensive but delicious and appropriate with the quality and presentation) for the bed the profile is hard but quite comfortable the air conditioner is cold, although at first it felt quite cold but after adapting the air conditioner was still turned on because it was quite hot in the cabin suggestions maybe sandals can be provided because if we take off sandals outside it is uncomfortable and if used the cabin becomes dirty, and umbrella facilities also because in my cabin there was no umbrella so when it was drizzling it was difficult to get out, after contacting via the application a new umbrella was delivered, the rest is satisfied staying here and planning to come back again",a year,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"untuk akses jalan masuk dari loket wisata jalan lumayan baik namun setelah masuk ke arah bobacabin jalan rusak parah perlu diperbaiki karena lumayan dalam lubangnya, saya mendapat cabin ditengah kalau ambil jalan lurus ternyata jauh mending ambil jalan menyamping lebih landai dan dekat untuk fasilitas kamar lengkap namun untuk ukuran saya yang besar toilet/wc nya terasa kecil untuk makanan kemarin banyak yang tidak ada jadi memilih keluar makan nah disini ticket masuk wisata sebaiknya jangan dibuang karena jika akan masuk lagi bakal ditanyakan tea time disore hari terasa nyaman dan tenang dengan pilihan yang ada pas dinikmati dibalkon dengan kabut (meski agak mahal tapi enak dan pantas dengan kwalitas serta penyajian) untuk tempat tidur profile nya keras tapi cukup nyaman ac dingin , meskipun pada awal datang terasa lumayan dingin namun setelah beradaptasi tetap menyalakan ac karena cukup gerah didalam cabin  saran mungkin bisa disediakan sandal karena kalau kita lepas sandal diluar itu tidak nyaman dan bila dipakai cabin jadi kotor , dan fasilitas payung juga karena dicabin saya tidak ada payung jadi saat grimis kesulitan untuk keluar , setelah menghubungi lewat aplikasi payung baru diantarkan , selebihnya puas mengginap disini dan berencana akan kembali lagi"

klepon ojitchi,4.0,"the atmosphere is quite okay, enter the tourist area (there is a ticket counter, you have to pay, it is counted daily) if the day is a bit hot, the reason is that the bobocabin location is not so cold and high in the morning-afternoon-afternoon. outdoor balcony but 1 cabin must have a seat outside and a bonfire for the portion of food I ordered several kinds, had a chance to try tea in the afternoon, the presentation was very funny and also had a chance to try the bonfire on my balcony for the gravy, the portions were large and quite filling, There is a lot of sauce and there are a lot of different side dishes for the grill, I like it with saikoro meat (cubed / diced beef) but it doesn't go well with the short plate meat but the sauce is perfect so there isn't much cingcong, just eat it and it turns out that you can choose the sauce, but yesterday I stayed haven't been able to choose maybe because it's just opened so it's not as complete as usual if you stay on weekdays, the privacy is nice and comfortable and quiet but if it's the weekend, he said there are only a few rooms left, so I recommend booking through the app first unfortunately you can't choose the cabin location you want , so it's just a coincidence that I got the top position, if I got the bottom, then I'm ready to go up and down the stairs, it's quite tiring, but fortunately, the atmosphere is quiet, the sound of grasshoppers and insects and it's cool, so it's comfortable to go around here and there, it's definitely -1 star, there's something lacking in my opinion, staff limited, so it's less quick if there's a shortage, the table isn't cleaned unless you ask/be informed first, so I often ask the staff hehe (from the night I bbq, breakfast in the morning but not cleaned first, wait for the staff to be informed before cleaning, it's not clean for the table and the floor, you just wear shoes, yes) there is a common kitchen area, but there is no pot, there is a dispenser (but the gallon is empty / used up), a sink (equipped with cleaning tools + soap), a microwave (good for cooking popmie / popcorn) there are insects (most of the ants) can get in the cabin area of ​​my room, it's quite annoying considering the ants are crawling near the panel on my mattress (prepare hogasan / insect repellent!), and unfortunately when I'm in the bathroom closet again, there's a friend sitting on my back , it was so cold that I thought the water was dripping because it was drizzling at the time, I was numb, it turned out to be a leech, luckily it didn't stick and bite a lot (there was a red mark but it was small and I'm safe until now, I'm fine) the bonfire's sitting position was not right, even the smoke all that got on my body and the table got dirty (make sure you light the fire after you finish eating!) and there are definitely many advantages for you who want to try staying here! the tea party set is satisfying (although pricey but super worth it, it feels like a picnic abroad) the night is cold and the wind blows very well, the bonfire soap and shampoo are fragrant and not stingy! It's perfect for those of you who need modern-day healing, because it's quiet, quiet, there's no TV, it's comfortable to play cell phones / consoles for two / four to create a calmer and happier relationship! WiFi is quite strong and stable! access to eat outside is quite close, although it takes effort if you want to walk because it is uphill so there is no fog at night, so the photos are still very clear. The staff's service is very satisfying and friendly! the parking area is quite spacious and beautiful in the morning (between the pine forests) the path is equipped with lights to make it comfortable if you want to go night-strolling, there is no competition for cabin technology in Indonesia (you can choose the color of the room lights as you like, door-lock-access, equipped with speakers) all facilities are expensive (feels super worth)",a year,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"suasananya cukup oke, masuk di kawasan wisata (ada loket karcis, harus bayar, hitungannya harian) kalo siang agak panas soalnya lokasi bobocabin kali ini enggak begitu dingin dan tinggi pagi-siang-sore banyak banget lalat nya, cukup mengganggu kalo kalian suka duduk di balkon outdoor tapi 1 cabin pasti dapat tempat duduk diluar dan tungku api untuk bonfire untuk porsi makanan saya sempat pesan beberapa macam, sempat coba teh saat sore hari lucu banget penyajiannya dan juga sempat coba bonfire di balkon saya untuk kuah, porsinya banyak dan cukup mengenyangkan, kuahnya banyak dan macam variasi lauknya juga banyak untuk grill, saya cocok dengan daging saikoro (cubed / diced beef) tapi kurang cocok dengan daging shortplate nya tapi sausnya sempurna jadi enggak banyak cingcong sih, tinggal lahap saja ternyata bisa pilih saus, namun kemarin saya menginap belum bisa pilih mungkin karena masih baru buka jadi enggak selengkap biasanya  kalo kalian menginap weekdays, privacy enak dan nyaman sepi tapi kalo weekend, katanya hanya sisa sedikit kamarnya, jadi saya sarankan booking saja lewat app dulu unfortunately kalian enggak bisa pilih lokasi cabin yang kalian mau, jadi yaudah kebetulan saya dapat posisi atas, kalo dapatnya bagian bawah ya siap2 saja naik turun tangga cukup melelahkan sih, tapi untung suasana tenang bunyi belalang dan serangga dan sejuk jadi nyaman2 saja keliling sana sini  pastinya bintang -1 ada hal yang kurang menurut saya staff terbatas, jadi kurang gercep kalo ada kekurangan mejanya enggak dibersihkan kecuali kalian mintol / diinfokan dulu, jadi sering-sering mintol staffnya saja hehe (dari malam saya bbq, paginya sarapan tapi enggak dibersihkan dulu, tunggu staffnya diinfokan baru dibersihkan, kurang bersih untuk meja dan lantainya, kalian pakai alas kaki saja ya) ada ruangan dapur bersama, namun enggak ada pancinya, isinya ada dispenser (tapi galonnya kosong / habis), wastafel (dilengkapi alat pembersih + sabun), microwave (lumayan buat masak popmie / popcorn) ada serangga (kebanyakan semut) bisa masuk di area cabin ruangan kamar saya, cukup mengganggu mengingat semutnya merayap2 dekat panel di kasur saya (siapkan hogasan / insect repellent!), dan unfortunately pas saya lagi di kloset kamar mandi, eh ada teman yang hinggap di punggung saya, dingin2 yang mana kupikir air menetes soalnya gerimis saat itu, saya kebas ternyata itu mah lintah, untung sih enggak menempel dan gigit banyak (ada bekas merah tapi kecil dan saya aman sampai sekarang sehat-sehat saja) bonfirenya posisi duduknya kurang pas, malah asapnya yang kena di badan saya semua dan mejanya jadi kotor (pastikan kalian nyalain api sehabis makan selesai ya!)  dan pastinya ada banyak kelebihan buat kalian yang pengin coba stay disini! tea party set nya memuaskan (meskipun pricey tapi super worth berasa kayak piknik diluar negeri) malam hari dingin dan sejuk angin berhembus cocok banget bonfire sabun dan sampo wanginya harum dan enggak pelit! cocok banget buat kalian yang butuh healing2 ala jaman now, karena sepi, sunyi, enggak ada tv, nyaman buat main hp / console berdua / berempat buat menjalin hubungan lebih tenang n happy! wifi cukup kencang n stabil! akses cari makan diluar cukup dekat meskipun butuh effort kalo mau jalan kaki soalnya nanjak begitu enggak ada kabut kalo malam, jadi foto-foto pun masih jelas banget pelayanan staffnya sangat memuaskan dan ramah! area parkirnya cukup luas dan indah kalo pagi (di antar hutan pinus) jalanan setapak dilengkapi lampu membuat nyaman kalo kalian mau night-strolling enggak ada saingan buat teknologi cabin se-indonesia (warna lampu kamar bisa pilih sesuka hati, door-lock-access, dilengkapi speaker) semua fasilitas barangnya mahal2 (berasa super worth)"

Josephine M,5.0,"the place is quite clean considering it’s literally the forest. the staff is very helpful especially when carrying stuff and friendly, not rude at all even though it’s really tiring to carry suitcases up and down. the price is reasonable. going up and down using stairs. it’s quite tiring going up and down if you get a cabin below. but the cabin below has a direct view of the trees and the air is really nice so the tiredness is cured. I recommend requesting a room that is not too low if you can’t go up and down stairs. overall very good experience.",a year,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,tempat cukup bersih consider it’s literally ini the forest. staff sangat amat membantu terutama saat bawa-bawa barang dan ramah enggak ada jutek nya sama sekali padahal capek banget bawa-bawa koper naik turun. price reasonable. naik turun pakai tangga. cukup capek naik turun kalo dapat cabin yang di bawah. tapi yang cabin bawah view nya langsung pohon2 and hawanya benar enak banget so terobati capeknya. rekom request kamar yang enggak terlalu bawah kalo enggak kuat naik turun tangga.  overall very good experience.

I was a bit confused about how to get there because google directed me through Tahura Soerjo, I finally found it, it turned out that it should have gone through Padusan. An unforgettable glamping experience. Fast service, everything is cashless and application based. Ordered a BBQ, complete, good equipment. The location is also clean, and the cleanliness is quite controlled, hopefully not only because it is new. A little note, anyone who sleeps here must be ready with a camping-style mattress. It's not soft, hehe Hopefully bobocabin padusan will run smoothly and be successful, and hopefully it will remain well-maintained, clean, and excellent service",a year,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"overall, bobocabin padusan sangat recommended. sempat agak kebingungan menuju ke sana karena diarahkan google lewat tahura soerjo, akhirnya ketemu, ternyata mestinya lewat padusan. pengalaman glamping yang tak terlupakan. layanan cepat, semua serba cashless dan application based. pesan bbq, lengkap, alat oke. lokasi juga bersih, dan cukup terkendali kebersihannya, semoga bukan hanya karena masih baru. sedikit catatan, siapapun yang tidur di sini harus siap dengan kasur ala camping.enggak empuk, hehe semoga lancar dan sukses bobocabin padusan, dan semoga tetap terawat, terjaga kebersihannya, dan terjaga excelence servicenya"

Devi Nasution,4.0,"honestly for the view and comfort it is perfect. However, there are several things that the bobocabin team could possibly improve. when we stayed, we tried to order the barbeque menu offered but it was a shame that many were not available. finally we ordered ""marble tenderloin"" and tea time, the correction was that at least the diners were provided with scissors to make it easier and the knife they were given was a bread knife which should be different from a steak knife, making it very difficult to cut thick meat.  the staff was very responsive, but seemed to be working alone until they were overwhelmed and rushed to leave us after giving us the set. The staff doesn't realize that sometimes there are also visitors who don't understand how to use a gas stove, hehe.  Hopefully in the future, the service can be further improved! :)",a year,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"jujur untuk pemandangan dan kenyamanan sangat sempurna. tetapi, ada beberapa hal yang mungkin bisa disempurnakan oleh tim bobocabin. saat kami menginap, kami mencoba memesan barbeque menu yang ditawarkan tapi sangat disayangkan banyak yang tidak tersedia. akhirnya kami memesan ""marble tenderloin"" dan tea time, koreksinya adalah setidaknya pengunjung disediakan gunting untuk memudahkan dan pisau yang diberi adalah pisau roti yang mana harusnya berbeda dari pisau steak, sehingga sulit sekali memotong daging yang tebal.  staff sangat responsif, tapi terlihat bekerja sendirian hingga kewalahan dan terburu-buru meninggalkan kami setelah memberikan set. staff tidak sadar bahwa terkadang ada juga pengunjung yang tidak mengerti cara menggunakan kompor gas, hehe.  semoga ke depannya, bisa lebih disempurnakan pelayanannya! :)"

Sheilaita Hartono,3.0,"honest review: for those looking for a different atmosphere with a natural view, then this place is suitable for you. but for the price and facilities offered, for me it's a bit less worth it. I paid around 1.3 million rupiah per night: small room size (for this I can understand because the concept is a cabin), no TV, no breakfast included, hard mattress, really just a room. to go to the hotel, we have to pay a certain amount of money calculated per person because the location is in a tourist area. another plus for this hotel: the staff is super friendly (ask for any help they are willing to help). so okay, to escape from the pollution and hustle and bustle of the city, you can stay here.",a year,Bobocabin Pacet Mojokerto,"honest review: untuk yang mencari suasana berbeda dengan view alam, maka tempat ini cocok untuk kalian. tetapi untuk harga dan fasilitas yang ditawarkan, bagi saya agak kurang worth it. saya membayar sekitar rp 1,3 juta semalam: ukuran kamar kecil (untuk ini saya dapat maklum karena konsepnya kabin), tidak ada tv, tidak include breakfast, kasur keras, benar-benar hanya kamar saja. menuju hotel, kita harus bayar sejumlah uang yang dihitung per-orang karena lokasinya berada di dalam area wisata.  nilai plus lain untuk hotel ini: staff nya super ramah (meminta bantuan apapun mereka bersedia membantu).  jadi ok lah, untuk escape dari polusi dan hiruk pikuk kota, kalian bisa stay di sini."

Deb Ok,5.0,"the best bobocabin is here 🤩 the cabin is clean, no insects, no mosquitoes, no ants, no leeches. If it's flies, it's common because in cold areas, if it's raining, there are no flies. there is a water heater that can also be used to bathe 3 people, if it runs out you can wait a few hours later. I brought my own portable cookware and food here. bobocabin is far from the resto if it is located in the middle of the tea garden. in front of bobocabin there are 2 stalls so it's safe to shop if you feel the hotel food is expensive. in stalls selling warm drinks rich in ginger milk, fries, indomie and biscuits that's all. the access here is full of asphalt, it's just winding, so it's good if you're good at driving. the street can fit 2 cars but it's really tight. the air is very cold, the temperature can be 15 degrees. don't forget to bring a jacket. straight to the road leading to the cabin, it's asphalt, not gravel, so it's safe and not muddy. The MBL parking lot is also in front of the lobby, so you don't have to worry about picking up your stuff. My mnrt bobocabin is the most child and elderly friendly canning. we can ask for the upper cabin if there are elderly people. here there are also several activities such as atv, white water rafting, tea walk. the night is not dark and not scary because there are many lights.",3 days,Bobocabin Pangalengan Bandung,"the best bobocabin is here 🤩 cabin bersih, enggak ada serangga, enggak ada nyamuk enggak ada semut enggak ada lintah. kalo lalat mah umum lah karena di daerah dingin kalo lagi hujan enggak ada lalat. ada water heater juga bisa untuk mandi 3 orang kalo habis bisa menunggu beberapa jam kemudian. saya ke sini bawa alat masak portable dan bahan makanan sendiri. bobocabin jauh dari resto kalo letakny di tengah kebun teh. di depan bobocabin sih ada 2 warung jdnya aman bisa ngewarung lah kalo merasa makanan hotel mahal. di warung jual minuman hangat begitu kaya susu jahe, gorengan, indomie dan biskuit begitu lah. akses ke sini sudah full aspal sih cuma berkelok2 jadi baiknya yang sudah mahir nyetir ya. jalanan muat untuk 2 mobil tapi memang mepet sekali. udara dingin banget suhu bisa 15 derajat. jangan lupa bawa jaket. terus untuk jalan menuju ke cabin sih aspal ya bukan kerikil2 jadi aman enggak becek2an. parkiran mbl juga di depan lobby jadi enggak repot turun naekin barang. mnrt saya bobocabin pengalengan paling ramah anak dan lansia. kita bisa meminta cabin bagian atas kalo ada lansia. di sini ada beberapa aktivitas juga seperti atv, arung jeram, tea walk. malam tidak gelap tidak seram karena banyak lampu."

Nabila Ayu Khairani,5.0,"much more delicious here than the one at Ranca Upas. in terms of the view and the room. I'm satisfied overall, but I want to recommend room no. 25-27, because it's located really well. It happened that my room was number 27, and it was very good. can open the door freely because there is only 1 cabin next door. it's just like you can't choose, because it's random. but if you order firewood, it seems to be a loss because you get wet wood so the flame is only for a short time. it doesn't turn on anymore. Maybe I can order if it doesn't rain. for a very complete food and bbq menu. no worries.",a month,Bobocabin Pangalengan Bandung,"jauh lebih enakkan di sini daripada yang di ranca upas. dari segi view dan kamarnya. overall puas sih, tapi mau rekomen untuk kamar no 25-27, karena dia letaknya oke banget. kebetulan kamar saya no 27, dan enak banget. bisa buka pintu dengan leluasa karena cuma ada 1 cabin di sebelah. cuma kayaknya enggak bisa memilih ya, karena dapetnya random. tapi kalo pesan kayu bakar, kayaknya rugi karena dapat kayu yang basah jadi nyalanya cuma sebentar. terus enggak nyala2 lagi deh. mungkin bisa pesan kalo pas enggak hujan saja ya. untuk menu makanan dan bbq lengkap banget. no worries."

wilujeng pujasari,4.0,"staycation here in January 2024, right during the rainy season. travel time from Bandung city is around 1.5 to 2 hours. enter the village and go through the tea plantation area. access is indeed a bit difficult, especially for guests who do not bring private vehicles. the check-in process is quite fast, there is no room service and communication access to officers by system. there is a canteen available but the food is all instant food. if you want to order other food, they have a partnership with nearby stalls but there is a time limit for ordering if I'm not mistaken the last one is at 6 pm. it's better to bring food supplies or snacks. the room is not spacious enough and it smells a bit of urine when you enter the bathroom. very cold, make sure to bring warm clothes. the distance between cabins is quite far and up and down stairs so it's better not to bring a suitcase. suitable for those who want to heal away from the hustle and bustle of the city.",2 months,Bobocabin Pangalengan Bandung,"staycation di sini pada bulan januari 2024, pas banget lagi musim hujan. waktu tempuh dari kota bandung sekitar 1,5 sd 2 jam. masuk perkampungan dan tembus ke daerah perkebunan teh. akses nya memang agak sulit apalagi bagi tamu yang tidak membawa kendaraan pribadi. proses check ini cukup cepat, tidak ada room service dan akses komunikasi ke petugas by sistem. ada tersedia kantin tapi makanan nya instant food semua. kalo mau pesan makanan lain, mereka ada kerjasama dengan warung sekitar tapi ada batasan waktu order kalo tidak salah terakhir di jam 6 sore. baiknya bawa perbekalan makanan atau snack. ruangan kurang luas dan sempat agak bau pesing saat masuk kamar mandi. dingin banget, pastikan bawa baju hangat. jarak antar cabin lumayan dan naik turun tangga jadi sebaiknya enggak bawa koper. cocok buat yang mau healing menjauhi hiruk pikuk perkotaan."

It's really that busy, but the feeling isn't that scary anymore, but the service is like this. Those who originally wanted to heal ended up holding back grumbling because of the service. hungry again",7 months,Bobocabin Pangalengan Bandung,"bad bad service, pas datang belum waktu nya check ini kita tungguin sampai waktu check ini. pas sudah waktunya kita tanya suruh tunggu dulu terus ada tamu lain bertanya langsung di tanya atas nama siapa, whatt!! buat banget. pesan makanan katanya tunggu 2 jam kalo dari local specialty tapi boro-boro dijawab nya saja lama banget itu chatnya. terus kan sekalian pesan bbq buat malam dari pas sampai sekitar jam 2 lebihan dia bilang oke otomatis harusnya sudah ada dong dipisahin begitu pesenan kita buat nanti karena dia enggak bilang kosong atau sold out. sampai jam 4 an itu makanan dari local specialty enggak ada kabar dan enggak ada balesan apa-apa jadi yaudah kita meminta bbq nya saja di keluarkan sekarang. tapi jam setengah 6 an dia bilang salah satu daging yang kita pesan sold out. whatt! tiba-tiba dia malah bertanya lagi buat jam 7 , maaf sudah jelas-jelas tadi bilang dikeluarin sekarang karena makanan yang dipesen dari local specialty enggak ada jawaban . anehh banget . memang lagi se rame itu ya perasaan lagi enggak serame itu juga tapi service nya kayak begini. yang tadinya mau healing malah menahan kesel ngedumel gara-gara service nya . lapar lagi"

Feri Rindanu,2.0,"This is actually not a complaint, just input for better service. The housekeeping staff are very friendly. We came when it was raining and were picked up using an umbrella. They helped us carry our belongings. I actually understand the check-in process, although there were minor problems (I ordered 2 rooms and asked for them to be side by side, but initially we got rooms that were not side by side because the system had arranged them, even though I had ordered them a long time ago and they said they could. But in the end we were able to get them side by side). The bottom line is that when my friend and I entered the room, I asked if the room included breakfast because the price was 800,000/room/night. Then the CS asked about the room, which was supposed to be checked in on November 15th. Even though I ordered a long time ago and I had sent the booking ID. Logically, why were we given a room if we only ordered it tomorrow? After we sent the voucher, they should have apologized. The system must be fixed. There was no apology until check-out.",7 months,Bobocabin Pangalengan Bandung,"ini sebenarnya bukan komplain cuma masukan saja untuk pelayanan lebih baik lagi . untuk staf house keeping sangat ramah kami datang saat hujan langsung di jemput pakai payung . barang-barang dibantu untuk dibawakan . proses check ini walau ada masalah kecil saya maklumi sebenarnya (saya pesan 2 kamar meminta bersebelahan , namun awalnya kita dapat kamar tidak bersebelahan dengan alasan kamar tidak bisa bersebelahan karena sudah diatur sistem, padahal saya sudah pesan jauh2 hari katanya bisa . namun pada akhirnya bisa dapat bersebelahan) cuma yang jadi garis bawah ketika saya dan teman saya sudah masuk ke dalam kamar . saya tanyakan untuk kamar apakah include breakfast secara harganya 800.000/room/night nya . terus cs nya ini menanyakan perihal kamar yang infonya seharusnya check ini tanggal 15 nov . padahal saya pesan jauh2 hari dan id pemesanan sudah saya kirim . secara logika kenapa kita dikasih kamar kalau pesannya baru besok . setelah voucher kami kirim seharusnya itu meminta maaf .. sistem kerjanya harus diperbaiki . sampai check out pun tidak ada kata maaf ."

Nutria Devi Pratamasari,4.0,"the first time here entered from the direction of Ciwidey and passed a road that could fit two cars but was quite narrow. then passed another tea plantation and finally arrived! the parking lot is spacious and the air here is indeed cold even though we arrived at 2 pm. then we will be greeted by the officer at the gate and directed to our room. lucky us we got a favorite room position with a location in the center which is famous for its beautiful view. in the evening we wanted to eat a bit confused because the stalls were quite far up, so we ordered via bobocabin such as grill yakiniku and rice, for drinks we ordered hot choco. advice is better to buy/bring food from outside because the choices are quite limited. oh yeah we ordered fried rice in the morning for breakfast, and the taste was so-so tending to be very sweet. for the price it is quite pricey. so far for the room is very comfortable to chill and thank God there is space for prayer. so it's not a cramped room. inside there is air conditioning but honestly the air conditioning was only used in the morning approaching noon. It's really cold here at night, I woke up at 3 am and when I checked it was 13 degrees cold. hot water functions normally. It's cool, it will be an exciting experience for me to stay here.",8 months,Bobocabin Pangalengan Bandung,"pertama kali kesini masuk dari arah ciwidey dan ngelewatin jalanan muat dua mobil tapi lumayan sempit. terus lewatin lagi perkebunan teh dan akhirnya sampai! parkirannya luas dan udaranya disini memang dingin padahal sampai nya di jam 2an siang. selanjutnya kita bakal disambut sama petugasnya di gerbang dan diarahin ke kamar kita. lucky us kita dapat posisi kamar yang favorit dengan lokasi di center yang mana terkenal dengan view nya yang bagus.  malamnya kita mau makan agak bingung soalnya warung lumayan jauh keatas, jadi kita order via bobocabinnya such as grill yakiniku dan nasi, untuk minumnya kita pesan hot choco. saran mending beli/bawa juga makanan dari luar karena lumayan terbatas pilihannya. ohiya kita pesan nasi goreng pada pagi harinya untuk sarapan, dan rasanya biasa saja cenderung manis banget. untuk harganya lumayan pricey ya.  so far untuk kamarnya comfort banget buat chill dan alhamdulillah ada space buat sholat. jadi bukan yang sempit begitu kamarnya. di dalamnya ada ac tapi jujur ac baru kepake pas pagi menjelang siang. malamnya disini dingin banget, sempat jam 3 pagi kebangun dan pas cek 13 derajat dinginnya. air panas berfungsi normal. keren sih bakal jadi pengalaman seru buat gue nginep disini."

Ernalia Rosita,3.0,"I'm used to going to bobocabin and as usual, bobocabin always spoils my eyes with its place and views that are suitable for a staycation. for this Pangalengan, masyaallah the views are very beautiful. advantages: + nice view, very beautiful and spoils my eyes + clean and very cool air + very friendly staff service + access to the location is a bit small, but good disadvantages: - too many flies! to the point where I couldn't enjoy eating on the chairs outside the cabin (cabin 28), when I opened the door the flies came into the cabin. moved to eat on the bobsmart chairs, still swarmed by flies - got a room with a less good view (cabin 28) and had to go up and down the stairs which was quite a lot because we also brought a 2 year old child - the price of food is quite expensive, maybe 2-3x the normal price. and there are not many choices of places to buy food around, so those who come here must bring their own food stock or bring a bigger budget - the breakfast menu is lacking, and the presentation is only wrapped in a paper box. can't be eaten in front of the cabin either because it's immediately swarmed by flies. maybe bobocabin can improve from my experience, although this cabin is in the middle of a garden so it is undeniable that there will be flies. but if there are a lot of them and it disturbs the comfort of the guests, maybe the solution should be considered carefully. overall for the room, service, and location. my family and I are still satisfied coming to bobocabin 👍🏻",9 months,Bobocabin Pangalengan Bandung,"sudah biasa ke bobocabin dan seperti biasa, bobocabin selalu memanjakan mata dengan tempat dan viewsnya yang cocok untuk staycation. untuk yang pangalengan ini masyaallah viewsnya cantik sekali.  kelebihan : + pemandangan bagus, sangat cantik dan memanjakan mata + udara bersih dan sangat sejuk + pelayanan staff sangat ramah + akses ke lokasi agak kecil, tapi bagus  kekurangan : - terlalu banyak lalat! sampai tidak bisa menikmati makan di kursi luar cabin (cabin 28), ketika buka pintu lalat pada masuk kedalam cabin. pindah makan di kursi2 bobsmart tetap dikerubungi lalat - dapat kamar yang viewsnya kurang bagus (cabin 28) dan harus naik turun tangga yang lumayan karena kami juga bawa anak umur 2th - harga makanan lumayan mahal, mungkin 2-3x harga normal. dan tidak banyak pilihan tempat beli makan di sekitar, jadi yang kesini wajib bawa stock makanan sendiri atau bawa budget lebih - menu breakfast kurang, dan penyajiannya hanya dibungkus dengan paper box. tidak bisa dimakan di depan cabin juga karena langsung dikerubungi lalat.  mungkin pihak bobocabin bisa berbenah dari pengalaman saya ini, walaupun memang cabin ini ada ditengah-tengah kebun jadi tidak dipungkiri kalau akan ada lalat. namun kalau jumlahnya banyak dan sampai mengganggu kenyamanan tamu, mungkin harus sangat dipikirkan solusinya.  overall untuk kamar, pelayanan, dan lokasi. saya dan keluarga tetap puas datang ke bobocabin 👍🏻"
Yanriski Stiasih,5.0,"I've been to bobocabin so many times. and just tried the canned one. got the best view room because I ordered from a long time ago via presale.. cool! - friendly staff ready to help - fragrant rooms, everything is still new. - if the room is not closed, there are many flies, but an insect repellent is provided. the name of the garden must be fertilized with flies. but if he goes home at night 🤣 it's just that there is no common kitchen area, if he is in Rancaupas there is a kitchen to use the microwave and wash the dishes. there is a very excited cat..",9 months,Bobocabin Pangalengan Bandung,"sudah sekian kali ke bobocabin. dan baru coba yang pangalengan. dapat kamar best view karena order dari lama via presale..keren! -staff ramah siap membantu - kamar wangii, semuanya masih baru. - kalo kamar enggak ditutup banyak lalat, tapi disediakan pengusir serangga. namanya kebun pasti pakai pupuk dibonusin laler. tapi kalo malam lalernya pulang 🤣 cuman enggak ada area dapur bersama, kalo di rancaupas ada dapur untuk pakai microwave dan cuci piring. ada kucing yang gemas banget.."

yufi ariftiyo sidi,5.0,"when I stayed I got cabin 23. The cabin was only about a month old since it was opened, but there were already several damaged facilities. The trellis/nets attached to the bathroom ventilation were loose at 2 points, several small insects managed to get in. then when I first entered the cabin door handle on the inside was a bit loose but still possible, eh on the second day it was completely loose and couldn't be opened from the inside. but luckily the chat was fast response and the mechanic who fixed it was also fast. that's the only complaint, and the price of food and drinks here is a bit ""pricy"", it can be 2-4 times the normal price. and one more plus point of this branch, if you stay on a date when there is no moon, and when the clouds are clear, you can get a photo of the milky way (with a supporting device) overall recommended, will return here one day",9 months,Bobocabin Pangalengan Bandung,"pas saya nginep dapat cabin 23. umur cabin baru sebulan kira-kira semenjak dibuka, tapi sudah ada beberapa fasilitas yang rusak. tralis/jaring2 yang menempel di ventilasi kamar mandi ada yang lepas 2 titik, beberapa serangga kecil sempat masuk. terus pas pertama masuk gagang pintu cabin bagian dalam sudah agak kendor tapi masih bisa, eh pas hari kedua benar-benar lepas dan enggak bisa dibuka dari dalam. tapi untung nya di chat fast response dan mekanik yang benerin juga cepat.  itu saja keluhan nya, dan harga makanan dan minuman disini agak ""pricy"", bisa 2-4x lipat dari harga normal.  and satu lagi point plus cabang ini, kalo nginep di tanggal pas lagi enggak ada bulan, dan pas awan lagi bersih, bisa dapat foto milky way (dengan device yang mendukung)  overall recommended, will return here one day"

Unfortunately, in my opinion, the restaurant menu at Bobocabin Rancaupas is still lacking in variety and yesterday I wanted to order a lot of them which were empty, apart from that the breakfast menu served was cold (perhaps because the air was cold so it cooled quickly).",a week,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"menginap semalam di bobocabin rancaupas ini tidak cukup, karena memang tempat nya nyaman dan sejuk, cocok untuk liburan bersama keluarga karena lokasi rancaupas terdapat beberapa tempat bermain anak dari penangkaran rusa, flying fox, atv, kolam renang air hangat dan onsen.  sayangnya menu restoran di bobocabin rancaupas ini menurut saya masih kurang bervariasi dan kemarin saya mau mesen banyak yang kosong, selain itu menu sarapan yang disajikan terasa dingin (mungkin karena udara dingin sehingga cepat dingin)."

catherine natalia,4.0,"for standard cabin bathroom is shared, but there are only 2.. rather stingy facilities, yes, where far the bathroom. in the room there are only 3 hook hangers, 2 pillows, 1 blanket, 2 towels, 2 toothbrushes (soap shampoo is provided in the bathroom), small like a motel. better not bring a lot of stuff. ask for extra pillow given 1. pay 84 thousand at the beginning (includes entrance ticket rancaupas 25 thousand / person & parking 1 day) in the area there are activities ATV, electric bike, onsen, archery, paint ball, swimming pool, rabbit park & ​​flying fox (all pay again). What I regret is that if you want to eat at the restaurant, it's a bit far from the accommodation (you have to take a vehicle). The price of food at the accommodation is a bit unreasonable, Indomie eggs are 35 thousand (it's better to order at Edun Coffee), there's a BBQ, but it's not suitable for pregnant women (the hot pot is always empty) or it's better to bring snacks/food that can be microwaved or just eat at the Gunung Coffee Shop, the restaurant is before the Rancaupas gate entrance.

The cost of accommodation does not include the entrance fee to the Rancaupas area and parking. The accommodation is operated with an application that is fully connected to various rooms, including bathrooms and shared communal space. Pros: - Warm room and safe building. - Rancaupas area has many outdoor activities, cute cafes, and delicious restaurants. Cons: - For standard rooms, the bathroom is outside with a ""shared bathroom"" method so the shower queue can be uncomfortable. - The reception is accessed using the application, so sometimes it is slow-resp. - Breakfast cannot be chosen, must accept whatever is served. - Visitors are not informed that there is an onsen as an accommodation facility. The onsen queue is also not regulated so it is unclear/difficult for visitors who want to use it. - There is no bell in the room so if housekeeping comes it can be ""hit and miss""",a month,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"saya dan pasangan menginap dua malam.  lokasi strategis dan fasilitas dibuat dengan mempertimbangkan keamanan, kenyamanan pengunjung yang menginap.  biaya penginapan belum termasuk biaya masuk ke kawasan rancaupas dan parkir.  penginapan dioperasikan dengan aplikasi yang terkoneksi full ke berbagai ruangan, termasuk kamar mandi dan sharing communal space.  pro: - ruangan hangat dan bangunan aman. - daerah rancaupas banyak aktivitas outdoor, kafe lucu, dan resto enak.  cons: -  untuk kamar standar, kamar mandi di luar dengan metode ""shared bathroom"" jadi antrian mandi bisa menjadi tidak nyaman. - resepsionis diakses menggunakan aplikasi, jadi kadang slow-resp. - breakfast tidak bisa pilih, harus menerima apa saja yang disajikan. - pengunjung tidak diberi tahu ada onsen sebagai fasilitas penginapan. onsen juga antriannya tidak diatur sehingga tidak jelas/menyulitkan pengunjung yang ingin menggunakan. - tidak ada bel dalam kamar jadi kalau house keeping datang bisa ""hit and miss"""

Novia,5.0,"stayed overnight at bobocabin ranca upas and was very satisfied, good experience! the location is in the ranca upas tourist area and the hotel price does not include the entrance ticket to the tourist attraction. the parking lot is close to the inn, only the road in the parking lot is rocky so it's a bit difficult to bring a suitcase 🥲 but if you request it, maybe the officer can bring it. at the beginning, it was explained about the room and the bobobox application to use all the features of the room. when staying overnight, book a standard room which is cute like a small house. but in my opinion it's not spacious enough because it's a bit difficult to move on the floor. but for the bed, it's very spacious with one thick and big blanket (and you can request to add another blanket, I suggest adding it because it's really cold lol). the bathroom for the standard one is outdoor, so it's a bit of an effort to have to go to the public bathroom and queue. there is hot water, but in my opinion it's not hot enough for the temperature in ranca upas 🥲 in the bobobox area, public facilities such as a prayer room, a kitchen with a microwave, a bonfire, and a lake are also provided. even can ride the boat for 15 minutes with additional cost, just request to the receptionist. overall very satisfied staying at bobobox ranca upas because the service is very good. the staff is friendly and very helpful. the distance is also not far from the deer breeding. recommended!",a month,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"menginap semalam di bobocabin ranca upas dan puas banget, good experience!  lokasinya masuk ke dalam kawasan wisata ranca upas dan harga hotelnya belum termasuk tiket masuk wisata. parkirannya dekat dengan penginapan, cuma jalan di parkirannya berbatu jadi agak susah buat bawa koper🥲 tapi kalau request mungkin bisa dibawakan sama petugas.  di awal dijelaskan tentang kamarnya dan aplikasi bobobox untuk menggunakan seluruh fitur dari kamarnya. waktu bermalam pesan kamar standard yang bentuknya lucu kayak rumah-rumah kecil. cuma menurutku kurang spacious karena agak susah bergerak di lantainya. tapi untuk kasurnya luas banget dengan satu selimut tebal dan gede (dan bisa request untuk menambah selimut lagi, saran menambah saja karena dingin banget wkwk).  kamar mandinya untuk yang standard outdoor ya, jadi agak effort harus ke kamar mandi umumnya dan antre. ada air panasnya sih cuma menurutku kurang panas untuk suhu di ranca upas🥲  di dalam area bobobox juga disediakan fasilitas umum seperti musala, dapur dengan microwave, bonfire, dan ada danau ala-ala. bahkan bisa naik sampannya selama 15 menit dengan tambahan biaya, tinggal request ke resepsionisnya ya.  overall sangat puas menginap di bobobox ranca upas karena servicenya bagus banget. staffnya ramah dan sangat helpful. jaraknya juga enggak jauh dari penangkaran rusa. recommended!"

Ali Aulia Rahman,5.0,"alternative vacation spot anti mainstream! for those of you who are tired of vacationing only in hotels, or vacationing if not Yogya or Bali, try this vacation in the middle of the forest!  If people spend the night in the forest, they definitely need a tent, don't they? eits but at bobocabin you only need to bring your body. because it has been prepared in a traditional capsule with complete facilities for you to sleep well, why capsules? because the shape is very minimalistic. It's not wide, but it's enough for two adults and one small child. inside the capsule, a super large mattress, water heater, and super wide glass window have been prepared to see the natural scenery that leaves you speechless if you're already in the cabin, it's a loss if you just sleep on the mattress. try hanging out outside the capsule, because a small table has been set up complete with two chairs for sitting around while having afternoon coffee. I also want to bake sabi, but this must be done with the permission of the officer first. The most important thing is to walk around the bobocabin area!

Rima Fitria,4.0,"first time trying bobocabin, more spacious than expected. but hopefully it can be improved, especially: 1. please add room lights inside the cabin, because yesterday based on experience there were only outside lights. it does reflect into the room, but it's not optimal for lighting. 2. there should be a tap outside in each cabin, so that if you need water for other needs you don't need to go to the bathroom (bathroom/toilet sharing, because the cabin standard. so it's a hassle to queue) 3. increase the number of bathrooms and toilets. yesterday there were only 2 toilet/bathroom points, with point 1 having 2 toilets 1 bathroom and the other 1 toilet 1 bathroom, very less conducive. I was already queuing on Friday, what about high season or weekend? 4. escorting guests to the cabin, it's not that spacious. but the mapping of the cabin and the uphill path, not to mention carrying luggage while looking for the cabin in my opinion is quite a task. overall it's okay for young people, especially, I was lucky because the room had a lake view and was close to the bathroom. can't imagine what it would be like to go to the bathroom for cabins that are high and far away.",5 months,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"first time coba bobocabin, lebih luas dari perkiraan.  tapi hopefully bisa improve, terutama : 1. mohon tambahkan lampu ruangan didalam cabin, karena kemarin base on experience hanya ada lampe bagian luar. memang sih mantul ke dalam ruangan, cuma enggak maksimal buat pencahayaan.  2. seharusnya ada keran diluar pada tiap cabin, agar jika butuh air untuk keperluan lain tidak perlu kekamar mandi (kamar mandi/toilet sharing, karena standar cabin. jadi repot antri)  3. penambahan jumlah kamar mandi dan toilet. kemarin hanya ada 2 titik toilet/kamar mandi, dengan dititik 1 ada 2 toilet 1 kamar mandi dan satunya lagi 1 toilet 1 kamar mandi, sangat kurang kondusif. itu saya dihari jumat sudah antri, apalagi high season atau weekend?  4. antar tamu ke cabin, memang enggak begitu luas. tapi pemetaan cabin dan jalur nanjak, belum lagi bawa barang bawaan sambil cari cabin menurut saya lumayan pr ya.  overall ok sih buat anak muda apalagi, saya termasuk beruntung karena kamar view danau dan dekat ke kamar mandi. enggak terbayang yang cabinnya diatas dan jauh itu bagaimana kalo ke kamar mandi."

I was very happy, because the price on new year's eve goes up, but they gave me a bonus yeay😍 the breakfast was delicious too, we ate in front of the lake 🥰 - the service was cool, the host on the app was also responsive. the condition was on the way to ranca upas I fell off my motorbike, it turned out that it was a long time before I felt my leg was limping, the staff saw me and offered to help me carry my things, asked about my condition, etc. thank you for your attention, the staff are cool 🙏 - unfortunately I didn't get a cabin with a lake view, it seems like if it was in front of the lake the natural view would be more felt haha ​​- the lake view is cool in the morning, chill in front of the lake - the amenities are complete, but there are no slippers - there are chairs in front of the cabin, sitting in front of the campfire at night 😍 - in front of the cabin there is a special shoe storage, it's good so it's neat. then provided umbrellas per cabin - the bobocabin area feels private and safe, not many people other than bobo cabin guests passing by, even though it's crowded so you don't feel overwhelmed by the number of people (except when walking to the deer breeding ground) - there are electric bikes on the way down, it's quite possible to go around ranca upas ranca upas is very cold at night, but none of the employees wear jackets, it's normal 😂 disadvantages: - there is only 1 toilet, 1 shower. for cabins that have more than 20, the comparison is concerning - there is a sign ""area monitored by CCTV"" when I looked it turned out that the CCTV was pointing towards the bathroom corridor. okay it doesn't point directly into the toilet, but it's not comfortable for women wearing hijab who need to use a hair dryer because the hair dryer is only in front of the sink in the hallway in front of the toilet & shower place 🥹 - not including deer breeding / ranca upas area tickets, and parking",6 months,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"datang saat malam tahun baru, booking di traveloka  kelebihan : - saat datang ke sana proses checkin cepat, lalu katanya dikasih bonus paket new year free kayu,bbq dan bfast. senang sekali sih, karena kan harga saat malam tahun baru naik ya, tapi dikasih bonus yeay😍 breakfast nya enak-enak pula, makan nya depan danau 🥰 - service nya keren, host di app nya responsive juga. kondisi lagi perjalanan ke ranca upas saya jatuh dari motor, ternyata lama berselang baru kerasa tuh kaki pincang, pegawai nya melihat saya pada menawari bantuan bawa barang, tanya kondisi saya, dll. terima kasih ya perhatiannya pegawainya keren 🙏 - sayang enggak dapat cabin view danau, sepertinya kalau depan danau lebih kerasa view alamnya haha - view danau nya keren sih waktu pagi chill depan danau - amenities nya lengkap, cuma enggak ada slipper - depan cabin ada kursi, duduk depan api unggun malem2 😍 - di depan cabin ada storage khusus sepatu, bagus sih jadi rapi. terus disediain payung per cabin - area nya bobocabin kerasa private dan aman, enggak banyak orang selain tamu bobo cabin yang lalu lalang, meski lagi rame jadi enggak merasa overwhelmed dengn banyak nya orang (kecuali pas jalan-jalan ke penangkaran rusa) - jalan ke bawah ada sepeda listrik, lumayan bisa keliling ranca upas  kondisi ranca upas dingin banget waktu malam, tapi pegawainya enggak ada yang pakai jaket, sudah biasa ya😂  kekurangan : - toiletnya cuman 1, shower 1. untuk cabin yang ada 20an lebih, perbandingannya memprihatinkan - ada tulisan ""area diawasi cctv"" pas saya lihat ternyata benar cctv nya mengarah ke lorong kamar mandi. okelah tidak mengarah ke dalam toilet langsung, tapi tidak nyaman untuk wanita berhijab yang perlu pakai hair dryer jadinya karena hair dryer hanya ada depan wastafel di lorong depan toilet&tempat shower🥹 - belum termasuk tiket penangkaran rusa/area ranca upas, dan parkir"

Esti Nur Amalia,5.0,"lodging with a unique experience! Recommendation: (!) Choose a room type that has a lake view! In my opinion, this room type has the best view. (!) Before going to Bobocabin, make sure your food and snack logistics are complete, because if you want to buy food when you arrive at the location, it is very limited, there are only local stalls and one cafe. (!) The air here is quite cold at night and in the morning (can be up to 15 degrees), make sure to bring a jacket/sweater. (!) If you bring small children, for example under 6 years old, choose a room with an en-suite bathroom (deluxe/executive cabin type). Things I like while staying at Bobocabin: (+) The view is beautiful, quiet, far from the hustle and bustle of the city. There is also a quiet time at 21.00 - 06.00 so as not to be noisy and disturb other visitors. (+) Each room is equipped with a dehumidifier, because the air here tends to be humid. (+) The shared bathroom is clean, and the toiletries provided are quite complete, such as shampoo, soap, hair dryer, shower, toilet, etc. (+) The car park is quite spacious (+) The location is right in Ranca Upas, to get to the deer feeding tourist spot, you can walk about 200m. Things to note when staying at Bobo Cabin: (-) The price of staying at Bobo Cabin does not include individual entrance tickets to Ranca Upas and vehicle tickets. (-) Because this accommodation is in nature, bring equipment to prevent unexpected things, such as anti-insect lotion, umbrellas, etc. Advice for Bobo Cabin Ranca Upas: Please pay attention to the maintenance of the cabin, some of the exteriors are already weathered and moldy.",6 months,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"penginapan dengan pengalaman yang unik!  rekomendasi : (!) pilihlah tipe kamar yang memiliki pemandangan danau (lake view)! menurut saya tipe kamar ini memiliki pemandangan yang paling bagus. (!) sebelum ke bobocabin pastiin logistik makanan dan cemilan sudah lengkap ya, karena kalau mau beli makanan ketika sampai dilokasi sangat terbatas, hanya ada warung warga lokal saja, dan satu cafe. (!) udara disini cukup dingin ketika malam dan pagi hari (bisa hingga 15derajat), pastikan membawa jaket/sweater. (!) jika membawa anak anak yang masih kecil misalnya dibawah 6 tahun, pilihlah kamar dengan kamar mandi dalam (tipe deluxe/executive cabin).  hal yang saya suka selama menginap di bobocabin : (+) pemandangannya bagus, sunyi, jauh dari hiruk pikuk perkotaan. ada quiet time juga pada jam 21.00 - 06.00 untuk tidak berisik yang dapat mengganggu pengunjung lain. (+) setiap ruangannya sudah dilengkapi dengan dehumidifier, karena udara disini cenderung lembab. (+) shared bathroomnya bersih, dan perlengkapan mandi yang tersedia cukup lengkap seperti shampoo, sabun, hair dryer, shower, wc, dll. (+) tempat parkir mobil yang tersedia cukup luas (+) lokasinya tepat di ranca upas, untuk ke tempat wisata memberi makan rusa bisa diakses dengan jalan kaki sekitar 200m.  hal yang perlu diperhatikan ketika menginap di bobocabin : (-) harga menginap dibobocabin belum termasuk tiket masuk individu ke ranca upas dan tiket kendaraan. (-) karena penginapan ini berada di alam, bawa perlengkapan untuk mencegah hal-hal yang tidak terduga, seperti lotion anti-serangga, payung, dll.  saran untuk bobocabin ranca upas : mohon diperhatikan perawatan untuk cabinnya, beberapa exterior sudah lapuk dan berjamur."

Ketut Catur,4.0,"In general, the service is quite good according to the standards of other Bobobox properties.  My bad experience was that I couldn't enter the cabin because the door couldn't be opened, the technician who was promised took too long to arrive, even though after working in less than 10 minutes the problem could be resolved.  Another bad experience was that our cabin seat was hit by a stray bullet from a group of paintball players who were holding an event near our cabin area. Apart from that, there were also stray bullets in the bathroom. Even though there were no casualties (it only hit inanimate objects), this incident was potentially dangerous for bobocabin guests. Indeed, it was not direct negligence on the part of Bobocabin, hopefully the management can file a protest with the Rancaupas management so that a similar incident does not happen again.  these two bad incidents really tarnished our overall holiday experience.  hidden costs. Another minus is that each guest will be charged an additional fee because we still have to pay Rancaupas entrance tickets, parking fees, and also ""camping"" fees even though we have clearly paid to rent a cabin at the bobocabin location.  In the future, perhaps the cabin rental rate includes entrance ticket, parking and rental of the Rancaupas ""camping"" area.",6 months,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"secara umum pelayanan cukup baik sesuai dengan standar properti bobobox lainnya.  pengalaman buruk saya adalah tidak dapat memasuki kabin karena pintu tidak dapat dibuka, teknisi yang dijanjikan terlalu lama datangnya, padahal setelah dikerjakan tidak sampai 10 menit masalah dapat diatasi.  pengalaman buruk lainnya adalah tempat duduk kabin kami kena peluru nyasar dari gerombolan pemain paintball yang mengadakan acara dekat area kabin kami. selain ada juga peluru nyasar ke kamar mandi. meskipun tidak memakan korban (hanya mengenai objek mati) insiden ini berpotensi bahaya bagi tamu bobocabin. memang bukan kelalaian pihak bobocabin secara langsung, mudah mudahan manajemen dapat mengajukan protes ke pengelola rancaupas supaya insiden serupa tidak terjadi lagi.  dua insiden buruk ini sangat menodai pengalaman berlibur kami secara keseluruhan.  hidden cost. minus lainnya adalah setiap tamu akan dikenakan biaya tambahan karena kita tetap harus membayar tiket masuk rancaupas, biaya parkir, dan juga biaya ""camping"" meskipun jelas jelas kita sudah membayar untuk sewa kabin di lokasi bobocabin.  masukan untuk kedepannya mungkin tarif sewa kabin sudah termasuk tiket masuk, parkir, dan sewa lahan ""camping"" rancaupas."

Anisa Nur Azizah,5.0,"a place to stay with a calm and cool natural atmosphere, I happened to stay at the Rancaupas igloo and it turned out to be very quiet on a weekday, unlike the weekend which is always crowded, but don't worry, there is a guard who is on standby 24 hours a day. for the igloo in Rancaupas itself, the facilities are quite complete, yes, the amenity is provided with breakfast, but only for the mattress itself, it has a single bed, so it feels less than satisfactory if you make pasutri. before breakfast, I recommend waking up very early and watching the sunrise in the savanna field while taking beautiful photos. The distance is not too far from the igloo itself because I came on a weekday, and the savannah field is quiet. Usually, on weekends, it must be very crowded, there are many people camping there.",7 months,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"tempat menginap dengan suasana alam yang tenang dan sejuk , kebetulan nginepnya di iglo rancaupas dan pas weekday ternyata sepi banget beda sama weekand yang selalu rame tapi tenang saja ada penjaga yang standby 24 jam nemenin di sana . untuk iglo di rancaupas sendiri fasilitasnya cukup lengkap ya amenitisnya ada dikasih sarapan juga cuman untuk kasurnya sendiri dapetnya single bad jadi rasanya kurang puas saja kalo buat pasutri . sebelum sarapan aku rekomendasikan buat bangun pagi banget dan lihat sunrise di padang savananya sambil foto foto cantik jaraknya enggak terlalu jauh kok dari iglonya sendiri karena aku datengnya weekday lagi lagi padang savananta sepi biasanya kalo weekand pasti rame banget banyak yang camping disana"

Reno P P,2.0,"The cabin is cool even without air conditioning, but the cabin seems poorly maintained and not very kid-friendly. The mosquito net is broken, so it's not replaced, so it's a bit dangerous for parents who bring children. The disappointing thing is the lack of bathrooms. The comparison between the number of cabins and the number of bathrooms is not balanced. In total, there are only two men's bathrooms and two women's bathrooms. So when it's morning / evening, the queue is very long. The most important thing is that it's not worth it, because near the public camping location, from morning to night, there are often people who use a very loud sound system so it disturbs the comfort when resting, it feels like a neighbor is having a wedding. The intention is to feel the peace of living in a forest area, but instead it feels like being in a residential area that is having a wedding. The only advantage is that it is close to the deer breeding area, but I think it's still not worth it for the price (weekend).",9 months,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"cabin dingin walaupun tanpa ac, namun cabin nya seperti kurang terawat dan kurang kids friendly. kawat nyamuk rusak saja masa tidak diganti jadi agak bahaya buat orang tua yang bawa anak-anak.  hal yang bikin kecewa adalah kurang nya jumlah kamar mandi. perbandingan jumlah cabin dengan jumlah kamar mandi tidak seimbang. total hanya tersedia dua kamar mandi laki-laki dan dua kamar mandi perempuan. sehingga ketika waktu pagi / sore antrian nya panjang sekali.  yang paling bikin enggak worth it, karena dekat lokasi camping umum dari pagi-malam suka ada yang pakai sound system kencang sekali jadi mengganggu kenyamanan ketika sedang beristirahat, rasanya seperti ada tetangga yang sedang hajatan nikahan. niat hati ingin merasakan ketenangan tinggal di area hutan, malah berasa berada di permukiman warga yang punya hajatan nikahan.  kelebihan nya cuma dekat dengan area penangkaran rusa, tapi saya rasa masih tetap kurang worth it buat harga nya (weekend)."
Arie Wijayanto,4.0,"for the room is really good, there order bobocabin deluxe can be in no. 28, the room is quite big for the three of us with a 9 year old child the bed is just right, plus a clean bathroom but be careful with the hot water, I don't know if I'm tacky or the machine is faulty, the water is too hot once it directly burns your hand, so be careful before using the hot water. for the service is not satisfactory in my opinion, my child's sandals were lost taken by a puppy near the inn, I complained there was no response and too underestimated, when I said it was lost because it was taken by a puppy I was lectured that there were no wild animals. even though this afternoon when I checked I asked the staff there to keep the puppy away, (not because I don't like animals but because I'm too careful not to get dirty) they said the puppy was tame. the location is in the forestry area in ranca upas, it's really nice if you want to be alone and away from the hustle and bustle of the city. oh yes for deluxe room no. 28, the location is also good, next to it there is a coffee shop from local farmers and it's perfect for breakfast if you want to look for noodles (because you don't get breakfast there) it's quite expensive in my opinion for the price of 1.4 you don't get breakfast. 1 more thing, don't forget to bring a jacket, because it's really cold there, it can be 17c at night",9 months,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"untuk kamar ok banget, kesana pesan bobocabin deluxe dapat di no. 28, kamarnya lumayan besar untuk kami bertiga dengan anak umur 9th pas lah kasurnya, ditambah kamar mandi dalam yang bersih tapi air panasnya hati-hati, enggak tau saya yang norak atau mesinnya yang error, airnya panasnya kebangetan sekali kena melepuh langsung tangan, jadi hati-hati sebelum pakai air panasnya.  untuk service nya tidak memuaskan menurut saya, sandal anak saya sempat hilang di ambil anak anjing di dekat penginapan, saya komplain tidak ada tanggapan dan terlalu meremehkan, saat saya bilang hilang karena di ambil anak anjing malah diceramahi tidak ada binatang liar. padahal sore ketika saya cek ini saya meminta staff disana untuk menjauhkan anak anjing tersebut, (bukan karena saya tidak suka binatang tapi berlebih menjaga agar tidak terkena najis) mereka billang anak anjing tersebut jinak.  lokasi di kawasan perhutani di ranca upas, enak banget deh kalo mau menyendiri n jauh dari hiruk pikuk perkotaan. oiya untuk kamar deluxe no. 28, lokasinya juga enak sebelah nya ada warung kopi dari hasil petani sekitar n pas banget buat sarapan kalo mau cari mi (karena disana tidak dapat sarapan) lumayan mahal menurut saya dengan harga 1,4 tidak dapat sarapan.  1 lagi jangan lupa bawa jaket, karena disana dinginnnnnn banget, malam bisa 17c"

Dimas Kusumoningprang,5.0,"It's been a long time since I returned to nature with comfort like in a hotel, I stayed in a standard cabin then was upgraded to a deluxe (cabin with toilet). The glass was really cold. It's been a long time since I've been to a tourist spot that's cold like this... the rooms are all good, the toilets are also clean , I also invited my 73 year old mother to walk to the cabin (approximately 200 meters from the front office) just be comfortable. Suggestions: 1. bring an umbrella 2. jacket 3. bbq for activities with the family. 4. games like monopoly, cards and the like so that there are activities with non-gadgets tips: take the time to go to the onsen (hot springs) which is at the front (on the right when you enter the upas garden) only 300k which is more private with a capacity of 5 people, if For me to be efficient, it's only 28k per person, it's further back, 1 onsen can have 3 and that's more than enough. The private onsen is in the final photo slide, while I didn't include the 28K one because of privacy 🙏 Oh, the signal here is difficult, but if you stay at the bobocabin, you can use WiFi and it's quite fast and the coverage area is affordable from the front to the inside",a year,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"sudah lama tidak kembali ke alam dengan kenyamanan seperti di hotel, saya menginap di cabin standart kemudian dapat upgrade ke deluxe (cabin dengan toilet) dinginnya gela banget deh lama saya enggak ke tempat wisata yang dinginnya seperti ini.. kamar all good, wc juga bersih, saya ajak ibu saya umur 73 tahun juga untuk jalan ke cabin (kira2x 200 meter dari front office) nyaman2x saja  saran : 1. bawa payung 2. jaket 3. bbq untuk kegiatan bersama keluarga. 4. game seperti monopoli, kartu dan semacamnya agar ada aktifitas bersama non gadget  tips: sempatkan untuk ke onsen (pemandian air panas) yang berada di depan (sebelah kanan ketika pas masuk ranca upas) cukup 300k yang lebih private daya tampung 5 orang, kalo saya untuk efisien yang 28k saja per orang letaknya lebih ke belakang 1 onsen bisa ber 3 dan itu lebih dari cukup. onsen private ada di slide foto akhir, sedangkan yang 28k saya enggak masukan karena privacy 🙏  oia disini susah sinyal tapi jika menginap di bobocabin bisa pakai wifii dan cukup kencang dan coverage areanya terjangkau dari depan hingga dalam"

Shinta Ervina Dewi,5.0,"My husband and I really like camping/going to places that are at one with nature, so during the anniversary my husband invited us to staycation at Bobocabin Rancaupas, and it was great...! seriously, I really felt the healing, I really liked my first camping in Rancaupas because it was cold, the fog in the morning made it serene, eh it turns out there is a bobocabin so you can still be at one with nature but with better facilities 😍😍 Bobocabin Rancaupas has 3 types of cabins, standard cabin, deluxe cabin and executive cabin.. because I didn't know and didn't see any reviews, I just chose the cheapest one, it turns out that the standard cabin has a shared bathroom outside.. but it doesn't matter because the toilet is still clean, the guys are really diligent in cleaning the toilet and always fill the toilet paper never runs out.. if the deluxe one has an indoor bathroom with a capacity of 2 people, the executive indoor bathroom has a capacity of 4 people.. there is no AC in the cabin, but it won't be hot because the Ciwidey area is really cold, if it still feels hot the windows can be opened, because there is still a screen so animals won't get in.. it's really beautiful here, the sound of crickets, birds, in the morning you can also get the typical Rancaupas mist, the air is really cool, The trees are tall and graceful, it's really serene 😭 like renting a hotel, here you get 2 mineral waters, 2 towels, 2 toiletries, and a coffee and tea set... there's also a kettle to boil hot water, outside there are 2 seats, table, umbrella and place for mini campfire.. (fit. If when your cabin isn't complete, just look for it in the cabin next door, because when I was staying someone took a chair and campfire from the cabin that didn't belong to them and didn't return it 🤦🏻‍♀️) here everything has to be scanned, but you really have to install the application bobobox because if you want to enter the cabin and bathroom you have to scan first, to change the lights and windows you can also use the application... basically the experience of staying here is really satisfying, God willing, I will definitely stay again but choose the deluxe one so you don't get tired if you want to be able to use the toilet 😂😂 maybe there was a little input, when we were in the lobby when we were checking, young people who didn't have any manners came across, immediately shouted and asked the phone, even though our position was being served by the master and we were opening the application to check, right? and the master didn't say anything wait a minute, he's still serving us, instead he answers and helps him check it too... honestly, I'm really bored, like hello, we're checking this, you know? Can the person who is absent be served too? and it turns out that they got a cabin nearby, and the young people were the ones who took the seats in other cabins, because the standard cabin should only be for 2 people, while there were 7/8 of them who only rented 2 cabins, so they took the rights to the cabins of the other people others... hopefully the management will pay more attention",a year,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"aku dan suami memang suka banget camping/ ke tempat yang menyatu dengan alam, jadi pas anniv suami ngajakin staycation di bobocabin rancaupas, and it was great..! serius berasa banget healingnya, camping pertama aku di rancaupas suka banget karena dingin, pagi2 kabutnya bikin syahdu, eh ternyta ada bobocabin jadi tetap mendapatkan menyatu dengan alam tapi dengan fasilitas yang lebih baik 😍😍 bobocabin rancaupas ada 3 tipe cabin, standart cabin, deluxe cabin dan executive cabin.. karena enggak tau dan enggak lihat review apa-apa aku pilih yang termurah saja, ternyata kalo standar cabin itu sharing kamar mandi di luar ya.. tapi enggak masalah karena tetap bersih kok toiletnya, mas2nya benar-benar rajin bersihin toilet dan selalu isi tisu toiletnya enggak pernah sampai habis.. kalo yang deluxe itu indoor bathroom kapasitas 2 orang, executive indoor bathroom kapasitas 4 orang.. dalam cabin enggak ada ac, tapi enggak bakal panas karena daerah ciwidey memang dingin banget, kalo tetap kerasa panas bisa dibuka jendelanya, karena tetap ada kasanya jadi binatang enggak bakal masuk.. disini benar-benar asri banget, suara jangkrik, burung, pagi2 juga dapat kabut khasnya rancaupas, udara sejuk banget, pohon2nya tinggi dan cangtip pokoknya syahdu banget 😭 seperti layaknya menyewa di hotel, disini dapat air mineral 2, handuk 2, alat mandi 2, dan set kopi teh.. ada teko panas juga buat masak air panas, kalo di luar ada tempat duduk 2, meja, payung dan tempat untuk api unggun mini.. (pas. kalo pas cabin kalian enggak lengkap, cari saja di cabin sebelah, karena pas aku nginep ada yang ngambil kursi, n api unggun dari cabin yang bukan miliknya dan enggak dikembalikan 🤦🏻‍♀️) disini semua serba harus scan ya, tapi wajib banget install aplikasi bobobox karena kalo mau masuk cabin n kamar mandi harus scan dulu, untuk ganti2 lampu dan jendela juga bisa pakai aplikasi.. pokoknya puas banget pengalaman nginep disini, insya allah pasti bakalan nginep lagi tapi pilih yang deluxe biar enggak capek kalo mau boleh toilet 😂😂 mungkin ada sedikiti masukan, saat di lobby pas lagi cek ini dtglah anak-anak muda yang enggak punya sopan santun, langsung nyelak n bertanya ke fo nya, padahal posisi kita lagi dilayanin masnya dan lagi buka aplikasinya buat cek kan.. dan masnya bukannya bilang tunggu sebentar masih layanin kita, malah dijawab2in n bantu dia cekin juga.. jujur rada bete banget, kaya hellow kita lagi cek ini lho kok bisa orang yang nyelak dilayanin juga? dan ternyata dapat cabin deketan, dan cabe-cabean itu yang ngambil2in kursi cabin2 lain, karena standar cabin kan harisnya cuma buat 2 orang, sedangkan mereka ber7/8 orang cuma sewa 2 kabin, jadi ambil hak cabin2 orang lain.. semoga lebih diperhatikan ya sama managementnya"

Silvia Nunu,5.0,"a pleasant stay! the three of us (2 adults and 1 child) stayed in a deluxe cabin with an en-suite bathroom. the cabin facilities are very complete like a hotel in general. the bathroom inside the cabin is complete with a shower, sink and toilet. also complete with standard amenities. there is no water gun, maybe because the bathroom floor is made of wood and the space is limited, reducing the risk of the interior becoming very humid. there is hot water with a strong water discharge! bathroom fixtures are also maximal :"") the brand is famous to the point of making me amazed hehe there are seats on the terrace balcony and also roofed so if it drizzles it doesn't matter. can order a bbq or steamboat package complete with cooking utensils (stove and pan) and cutlery). can also order a campfire package that will be helped to set by the staff. view of the cabin towards the lake and right under the tall trees. the experience of operating the cabin with a control panel or from a cellphone is also quite easy. its mainstay feature is the window that can be blurred through the panel. quite a ride with children 😁 in the lobby, there is a cupboard filled with books that can be borrowed. there are many frogs around the lake, when night performs an orchestra! very exciting. there are many other insects around the cabin that we like. there are many cicadas that enter the cabin when opening the door at night which makes us very happy hahahaha. exciting!",a year,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"pengalaman menginap yang menyenangkan! kami bertiga (2 dewasa dan 1 anak) menginap di kabin deluxe dengan kamar mandi di dalam. fasilitas kabin sangat lengkap seperti hotel pada umumnya. kamar mandi di dalam kabin lengkap dengan shower, wastafel dan toilet. lengkap juga dengan amenities standar. tidak ada water gun, mungkin karena lantai kamar mandi dari kayu dan space yang terbatas, mengurangi resiko interior yang menjadi sangat lembab. ada air hangat dengan debit air yang kencang! fikstur kamar mandi juga maksimal :"") merknya ternama sampai membuat saya terkesima hehe  terdapat tempat duduk di balkon teras dan juga beratap sehingga kalau gerimis tidak masalah. bisa memesan paket bbq ataupun steamboat lengkap dengan alat masak (kompor dan kapan) serta alat makan). bisa juga memesan paket api unggun yang akan dibantu diset oleh staffnya.  view kabin ke arah danau dan tepat berada di bawah pepohonan tinggi. pengalaman pengoperasian kabin dengan kontrol panel atau dari handphone juga cukup memudahkan. fitur andalannya adalah jendela yang dapat di blur lewat panel. lumayan wahana bersama anak 😁  di bagian lobby, ada lemari berisi buku yang dapat dipinjam.  ada banyak kodok sekitar danau, ketika malam melakukan orkestra! seru sekali. ada banyak serangga lain di sekitar kabin yang kami gemari. ada banyak tonggeret yang masuk ke kabin ketika membuka pintu di malam hari yang membuat kami senang sekali hahahaha. seru!"

If you want to buy food, you can grab the nearest food and then chat with your uncle and pick up other food when you get there. in the 3-4th photo is the food that was grabbed from the area. you can get a lot and the food is typical there so it's really ok…. want to try the one in Malang next time... ✨",a year,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"ada 3 tipe (kamar mandi luar, kamar mandi dalam muat 2 orang, dan kamar mandi dalam muat 4 orang) sayang banget sisa yang kamar mandi luar. saking dinginnya malam kebangun 2x dan hes kencing keluar kamar. but such a good memories banget staycation disini. terus pagi jam 8 ke penangkaran rusa sudah buka. ok banget. saran dari ku. kalo mau beli makan boleh banget grab food yang terdekat terus chat amangnya nitip makanan lain pas otw kesitu. di foto ke 3-4 itu makanan yang kah grab food dari amangnya. dapat banyak dan makanannya khas situ jadi ok banget…. mau coba yang di malang next time… ✨"

BTW, when booking a room you have to specify whether it includes a bathroom or not, because when you ordered a standard cabin it turned out there was no bathroom, the bathroom was so central. the bathroom has one toilet, one shower. so you need to queue if there are people. hair dryer and bath soap are provided in the bathroom. for toothbrushes and towels in the room.",a year,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"lokasinya recommended untuk healing. suasanya sejuk, pemandangannya bagus. dekat sama perternakan rusa dan perkebunan strawberry (bisa sambil jalan). kamarnya nyaman, smart room begitu bisa pilih led lampu, blur window, dan connect lagu lewat bluetooth. oiya smart lock menggunakan 1 device, untuk masuk kamar dan masuk kamar mandi, kalau datang berdua mungkin perlu confirm di receptionist biar bisa buka lewat dua device. minus nya karena dipannya kotor, jadi ragu apakah kasurnya bersih atau tidak. btw pemesanan kamarnya harus detail apakah include kamar mandi atau tidak, karena waktu pesan cabin yang standard ternyata tidak ada kamar mandinya, kamar mandinya terpusat begitu. kamar mandinya satu toilet, satu tempat mandi. jadi perlu antri kalau pas ada orang. disediain hair dryer, sabun mandi di kamar mandinya. kalau untuk sikat gigi dan handuk di kamar."

Irwan Citrajaya,4.0,I stayed in cabin 9. The first thing I felt when I opened the door was the smell of damp air. The cabin was designed with a small window that was closed at the bottom and without ventilation at the top so that air circulation was hampered. The small window could be opened but the magnetic mosquito net could not be closed tightly so there was a risk of insects entering.,2 years,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,saya menginap di cabin 9. pertama yang saya rasakan ketika membuka pintu adalah bau udara lembab. kabin dirancang dengan jendela kecil yang tertutup di bawah dan tanpa ventilasi atas sehingga sirkulasi udara terhambat. jendela kecil bisa dibuka namun kawat nyamuk magnet tidak bisa tertutup rapat sehingga ada risiko serangga masuk.

I arrived when it was raining, you could park your motorbike in front of the bobocabin, but without a roof. from the receptionist you can borrow an umbrella to go to the cabin. the cabin is very small, the facilities are a bed, a small table with a heater, 2 mineral water, 2 glasses, 2 towels, and 2 toothbrushes with small pepsodent. 3 clothes hangers, and in my opinion this is not enough, there is indeed no closet provided, but at least, please add more hangers if there is no closet to put people's clothes and jackets, if there is no professional towel hanger, my cabin will be a bit messy. then, the toilet facilities - very lacking! here there are 22 cabins, the standard calculation is 2 people 1 cabin, there are 44 people, right, there is only 1 toilet for men, one bathroom for men and also 1 bathroom (there is a hair dryer according to my wife) for women and 1 toilet for women. btw there is one being built near the reception, but when I went there with the builder he said it was not ready yet. and if possible provide a jet washer, not a toilet that sprays water out from the inside, because this men's toilet tends to get messy, as a result, if I go to the toilet I will go out of the bobocabin and choose to go to the public toilet, a squat toilet, which is near the canteen, lol at night, the lighting is quite good, my wife asked me to accompany her to pee at 2 am, it was still bright towards the toilet, even though it was a bit of a walk. btw because of the rain, the room became very cold, and the glass became foggy and watery until it got wet, puddled almost on the screen and the speaker, so we put tissue to absorb it. hopefully it helps those who want to stay overnight.",2 years,Bobocabin Ranca Upas Bandung,"nginap semalam saja disini. untuk masuk area ini, bayar yes, 69k untuk 1 motor dan 2 orang (bisa keluar masuk kalau mau keliling keluar ya-tapi disini juga ada wahana wisata lain, bisa dimaksimalkan lihat-lihat).  untuk harga, saya lagi dapat diskon hampir setenah, rasanya senang, tapi pas sampai dan dapat unit. ih wow dapat pemandangannya tenda orang bakar2an dan kabin lain, wkakakakakak  jasi saya dapat unit 22, dan saya perhatikan, unit 21 dan 22 adalah unit dengan view tidak ada bagus2nya karena lihat kabin orang, wkakakkakaka, pengennya dapat pemdangan kayak riview2 youtuber eh zonk,  jadi jangan sampai dapat unit ini ya, ada harga ada rupa sepertinya.  saya dtng pas ujan, parkiran motor bisa di depan bobocabinnya, tapi tanpa atap ya . dari reciepsionis bisa pinjam payung, untuk menuju kabin.  kabin ukuranya sangat kecil, fasilitas ada kasur, meja kecil dengan ada heater, air mineral 2, gelas 2, handuk 2, dan sikat gigi 2 dengan pepsodent kecil.  gantungan baju 3, dan ini menurut saya kurang saja, memang tidak disediakan lemari, tapi paling enggak, tolong itu gantungan membanyaki ya kalau memang enggak ada lemari buat naruh baju orang jaket, kalau enggak ada gantungan handuk yang profer, jadi dikabin saya agak messy messy.  terus, fasilitas toilet- sangat kurang! disini ada 22 kabin, hitung standart ada 2 orang 1 kabin, ada 44 orang dong, lah, toilet cuma 1 buat laki laki, kamar mandi satu buat laki laki dan juga 1 kamar mandi (ada hair dryer kata istri saya) buat perempuan  dan 1 toilet buat perempuan.  btw ada yang sedang dibangun dekat recepsionis, tapi pas kesana sama tukang katanya belum ready. dan kalau boleh sediain jet washer dong, jangan toilet versi semprotan keluarair dari dalem, soalnya ini wc laki laki suka belepotan kayaknya, alhasil, saya kalau toilet akan keluar are bobocabin dan memilih ke toilet umum, wc jongkok, yang dekat kantin, wkakaka  kalau malam, penerangan cukup oke, istri ane meminta temenin pipis jam 2 malam masih terang ke arah toilet, walau agak jalan ya.  btw karena ujan, kamar jadi sangat dingin, dan kaca jadi berembun berair begitu sampai basah, menggenang hampir kena layar sama spekaernya, jadi kami taruhin tisu biar nyerap.  ya mudah-mudahan membantu yang mau nginap ya."

dina situmeang,5.0,"For those who want a millennial-style staycation, Bobocabin Signature Kaldera is the most fitting choice. Plus ✅ 1. For a cabin class, this Bobocabin is quite comfortable and has complete facilities. Inside the cabin there are towels, slippers, water heaters, & other facilities like a hotel. 2. The difference is, there is no TV in the cabin. But don't worry, they provide high-speed wifi and Bluetooth speakers in the cabin as entertainment during the staycation. 3. What's more unique is that this cabin is a smart cabin. So from the door lock to the operation of the cabin, it is operated via the guest's smartphone or the b pad available in the cabin. Minus ⛔ 1. The location of Bobocabin, which is in the Kaldera area, is quite far from the center of Parapat, +/- 20 km. So it's a bit difficult to reach a place to eat. So it's a good idea to stock up on food before going to the location or you can also order food from Bobocabin. But the price of the food menu is a bit overpriced in my opinion. 2. Because currently there is no family cabin type available at bobocabin signature toba, so in my opinion it is not recommended for a family staycation with children. In addition to the cabin being relatively small, the location of bobocabin is also far from places to eat. To get a cheaper cabin price than the travel application, I recommend making a reservation through the bobobox application. In addition to being cheaper, the application also often provides discount vouchers. 📍 bobocabin signature toba, kaldera, motung, ajibata, sumut 🔖 price range rp. 669.0 to rp. 850,000 more info, visit ig @dinafujisari",a year,Bobocabin signature Toba,"yang mau staycation ala milenial, bobocabin signature kaldera pilihan paling pas.  plus ✅ 1. untuk sekelas kabin, bobocabin ini cukup nyaman dan fasilitasnya lengkap. di dalam cabin adh tersedia handuk, slippers, water heater, & fasilitas lainnya layaknya hotel.  2. bedanya, di dalam cabin enggak disediakan tv. tapi jangan kuatir, mereka menyediakan wifi dengan kecepatan tinggi dan bluetooth speaker di dalam cabin sebagai bahan hiburan selama staycation.  3. uniknya lagi, kabin ini merupakan smart cabin. jadi dari kunci pintu sampai pengoperasian cabin dioperasikan melalui smartphone tamu atau b pad yang tersedia dalam kabin.  minus ⛔ 1. lokasi bobocabin yang berada di kawasan kaldera, lumayan jauh dari pusat kota parapat, +/- 20 kamu. jadi untuk agak sulit untuk menjangkau tempat makan. jadi ada baiknya, untuk stock makanan sebelum ke lokasi atau bisa juga pesan makanan dari bobocabin. tapi harga menu makanannya agak overprice menurut aku.  2. karena saat ini belum tersedia type family cabin di bobocabin signature toba, jadi menurut ku kurang recommended buat staycation keluarga yang membawa anak. selain kabin nya yang tergolong kecil, lokasi bobocabin juga jauh dari tempat makan.  untuk dapat harga kabin lebih murah dari aplikasi travel, aku rekomendasikan reservasi melalui aplikasi bobobox. selain lebih murah, aplikasi tersebut juga sering memberikan voucher diskon.  📍bobocabin signature toba, kaldera,  motung, ajibata, sumut 🔖price range rp. 669.0 s/di rp. 850.000  more info, visit ig @dinafujisari"

I ordered the type with a private jacuzzi and it was really nice for soaking, just prepare your own foam or soap. this type has an en-suite bathroom and there is also hot water and a hair dryer.",6 months,Bobocabin The Tavia Puncak,"tempatnya agak masuk gang, tapi pas di dalam luas, kayak jadi satu komplek dengan penginapan lain. tanda masuk nya cukup besar tinggal mengikuti arah penunjuk jalan, cuma untuk parkir motor agak lewat jalan kecil tapi nanti parkir dimana saja dan akan dibantu dibawakan motornya oleh petugasnya ke tempat parkir dekat bobocabin nya. suasana, hawanya enak banget tenang dan ada suara air sungai ciliwung yang cukup deras. cocok buat healing.  tidak ada fasilitas tv karena memang di peruntukan yang mau refreshing. fasilitas toilet, mushola sangat bersih namun disayangkan untuk dapur umum nya masih kosong, bahkan untuk refill air tidak ada galon hanya wastafel cuci piring saja. bisa pesan makanan melalui aplikasi bobobox nya mereka. rate harga makanannya standar. enggak usah khawatir karena keluar dari gang sudah langsung ketemu jalan raya puncak dan ada banyak resto makanan disana serta indomaret atau alfa.  aku pesan yang tipe dengan private jacuzzi dan enak banget buat berendam tinggal siapin busa atau sabun mandi sendiri saja. tipe ini ada kamar mandi dalam dan ada air panas juga serta hair dryer."
Sri Muliani,5.0,"a fun glamping experience at bobocabin. thank you very much to sis amel, the staff on duty at bobocabin who went above and beyond in helping us and providing for our needs while at bobocabin. location: close to the toll road and restaurants at the peak food: easy to find food around, you can also order bbq and steamboat at bobocabin, later the cooking and eating utensils will be prepared cabin: clean, compact but complete with equipment facilities: okay, but hopefully in the future a microwave and dispenser can be provided. it's better to eliminate mineral water bottles and replace them with glass bottles that can be refilled at the dispenser to make it more eco-friendly :) overall bobocabin tavia is highly recommended for a short gateway to the natural nuances guys",7 months,Bobocabin The Tavia Puncak,"pengalaman glamping yang menyenangkan di bobocabin. terima kasih banyak ke kak amel, staff yang bertugas di bobocabin yang sudah went above and beyond dalam membantu kami dan menyediakan kebutuhan kami selama di bobocabin.  lokasi: dekat dengan tol dan resto2 di puncak makanan: cari makan di sekitar gampang, bisa juga pesan bbq dan steamboat di bobocabin, nanti disiapkan peralatan masak dan makannya kabin: bersih, compact tapi lengkap peralatannya fasilitas: sudah oke, tapi semoga kedepannya bisa disediakan microwave dan dispenser. botol air mineral lebih baik ditiadakan dan diganti dengan botol kaca yang bisa diisi ulang di dispenser supaya lebih eco-friendly :)  overall bobocabin tavia sangat recommended buat short gateway ke nuansa alam guys"
Gandarich,4.0,"First time trying bobocabin here is cheap because you can get a discount.  1. the pole sign looks small, you have to use google maps. 2. a little confused about the directions to bobocabin. because I took the motorbike and parked it, I also didn't understand that I had to ride past people's villas. If you have a car, I don't know where to park it. 3. the hotel staff is friendly, kind and the explanation of the application is quite good. 4. I got a room near the receptionist so sometimes I like to be looked at quietly. 5. The bathroom is too far away so it's a bit scary for the timid. 6. the atmosphere is calm, quiet, peaceful, peaceful 7. some toilets cannot be used. 8. Bluetooth speakers are difficult to connect, a bit awkward",8 months,Bobocabin The Tavia Puncak,"pertama kali coba bobocabin disini murah karena dapat potongan harga.  1. pole sign terlihat kecil harus pakai google maps. 2. sedikit bingung petunjuk ke bobocabin. karena bawa motor terus parkirannya juga enggak paham harus numpang lewat villa orang wkwk. kalao mobil entah dimana parkirnya. 3. petugas hotelnya ramah, baik dan penjelasan aplikasi cukup baik. 4. dapat kamar dekat dkt resepionis jadi kadang suka diliatin mulu wkwk 5. kamar mandi terlalu minggir jadi agak seram buat yang penakut. 6. suasana tenang, sunyi, tentram, damai 7. toilet ada yang enggak bisa digunakan. 8. bluetooh speaker susah terkoneksi, agak bete"

Teguh Aditya,3.0,"got a chance to stay here with a promo price of only 300 thousand. this is the second bobocabin in bogor and in puncak, this one is relatively closer because it is still in the cipayung area, while the other one is in puncak pas. pros: - relatively closer to the toll road, if there is a traffic jam, the distance and time between cipayung and puncak pas will be really felt - ambience is really good, the atmosphere is calm, at night during quiet hours, it is really quiet. - there are only 10 cabins, so it is relatively calm, not many people going back and forth - the wifi is quite fast - the shared bathroom is clean - friendly staff cons: - same as the one in puncak pas, the location is inside another resort, the problem is the instructions are not very visible, very small - the digital key by qr code which is one of its advantages, is actually broken in the cabin I stayed in. given a manual door key, eh can't be used to lock it either, because I was tired and lazy to complain, as a result all night and until the next day, the door was only closed without being locked / could be locked. maybe the factor that there are only 10 cabins also makes it feel relatively safe because there are not many people. - there is no drinking dispenser in the public kitchen, so you have to boil water from the tap yourself. while in the basic cabin there is no sink, so you have to go to the shared bathroom. - the bed is hard, this may be relative, but for me it is hard - when checking out in the morning at 7, checking out from the app cannot be done, at least you have to wait until 10. suggestions: - maybe you can consider amenities, at least toothbrushes and toothpaste, which can be requested by request only. - the direction to the river and around the river, do you need to put a safety warning sign? coincidentally yesterday when it was hot so the current was small, but during the rainy season it is not impossible that the current will be stronger.",8 months,Bobocabin The Tavia Puncak,"dapat kesempatan untuk menginap disini dengan harga promo cuma 300 ribu-an.  ini adalah bobocabin kedua di bogor dan di puncak, yang ini relatif lebih dekat karena masih di daerah cipayung, sementara yang satu lagi di puncak pas.  pro: - relatif lebih dekat dari tol, kalo lagi macet akan berasa banget jarak tempuh dan waktunya antara ke cipayung dan ke puncak pas - ambience oke banget, suasananya tenang, kalau malam saat jam tenang, benaran sunyi. - cuma ada 10 kabin, jadinya relatif tenang enggak banyak orang bolak balik - wifi nya lumayan kencang - kamar mandi bersamanya bersih - staff ramah  cons: - sama seperti yang di puncak pas, lokasinya masuk ke dalam resort lain, masalahnya petunjuknya kurang kelihatan, kecil banget - kunci digital by qr code yang jadi salah satu unggulannya, malahan rusak di cabin yang saya tempatin. dikasih kunci pintu manual, eh enggak bisa dipakai buat ngunci juga, berhubung sudah capek dan malas komplain, alhasil semaleman dan sampai besoknya, pintu cuma ditutup tanpa dikunci / bisa ngunci. mungkin faktor cuma ada 10 kabin juga jadinya merasa relatif aman karena enggak banyak orang. - di dapur umum enggak ada dispenser minum, alhasil harus masak air dari keran sendiri. sementara di kabin basic enggak ada wastafel, alhasil musti ke kamar mandi shared. - tempat tidur keras, ini mungkin relatif, tapi buat saya sih keras - pas check out pagi hari jam 7, check out dari app enggak bisa dilakukan, minimal harus menunggu jam 10.  saran: - mungkin bisa dipertimbangkan amenities, minimal sikat gigi dan pasta gigi, yang bisa diminta by request only. - arah ke sungai dan sekitar sungai apa perlu diberi tanda peringatan keamanan? kebetulan kemarin saat panas jadi arusnya kecil, tapi saat musim hujan tidak mustahil arusnya akan lebih deras."

As for the view at Bobocabin Ubud, there's actually nothing special, the view is from the cabins. the journey is far from the main road and dark. It's better to come just before dark. I think other variants are also needed for breakfast.  but so far the experience has been fun and satisfying! recommended 🤍🙏🏻",7 months,Bobocabin Ubud Bali,"pelayanannya super cepat dan ramah. memuaskan! tempatnya nyaman. kalau pesan weekdays memang lebih murah apalagi ada promonya kalau pesan di app ada potongan sampai 110k. bisa manggang2 dan ada api unggun. harganya masih terjangkau kok.  untuk view di bobocabin ubud sebenarnya enggak ada yang spesial, pemandangannya ya cabin2 itu. perjalanannya jauh dari jalan utama dan gelap. mendingan memang datang pas sebelum gelap. untuk breakfastnya juga butuh varian lain kayaknya.  tapi sejauh ini pengalamannya seru dan puas kok! recommended 🤍🙏🏻"

Abdhi P,4.0,"the place is nice, the receptionist crew is also friendly, and also escorts you to the bottom, crazy how far it is at the end again lol. overall it's good to stay here. the disadvantages are: 1. it's really far from the parking lot to the place to stay, if there is some kind of escalator that would be nice lol. 2. also please check the room for insects, because the place is very natural, yesterday I found a small insect like a scorpion and its tail, it's scary. 3. please add drinking water too, or provide a gallon somewhere, it's been a long walk but it turns out there's only a little drinking water, only 2 bottles (330ml per bottle) too. 4. there are a lot of stairs, not pregnant woman friendly :) 5. the breakfast tastes lacking, yesterday the case was fried rice, suggestion for the receptionist, please remind the guest to make sure there are no items left to be brought to the room like that, because I'm afraid if the room is at the end it will be too lazy to go back to the parking lot again. my case was like that yesterday I had to go back again because something was left behind :)",8 months,Bobocabin Ubud Bali,"tempatnya bagus, crew resepsionisnya juga ramah, dan mengantarkan juga sampai bawah, gila jauh banget mana diujung lagi wkwk. overall good lah untuk stay disini.  kekurangannya sih: 1. jauh banget dari parkiran ke tempat stay nya, kalo ada semacam eskalator enak itu wkwk. 2. terus tolong juga kamarnya dicek takut ada serangga, karena tempatnya di alam banget, kemarin sempat nemu serangga kecil kayak kalajengking begitu buntutnya, ngeri sih. 3. tolong air minum nya ditambahin juga, atau kasih galon dimana begitu, sudah jalan jauh ternyata air minumnya dikit cuman 2 botol (330ml per botol) pula. 4. tangganya banyak, tidak bumil friendly :) 5. sarapannya rasanya kurang, kemarin casenya nasgor  saran untuk resepsionisnya, tolong di reminder tamunya untuk memastikan tidak ada barang yang ketinggalan untuk di bawa ke kamar begitu, karena takutnya kalo kamar nya diujung kan malas banget ya balik ke parkiran lagi. case saya begitu kemarin terpaksa balik lagi karena ada yang ketinggalan :)"

Everywhere there are lots of ""electronic binoculars"" aka CCTV 😉 so you feel safe, the shared bathroom is separate for men and women, hehehe.

(if you come here, bring your own bottle of aqua) - toilet is far away. if you people often pee, better don't stay here because you're tired and go back and forth to pee, tips for staying here from me: don't bring suitcases & belongings like souvenirs. because the room is small and difficult to open in the room & very difficult to carry from the reception to the room.",a year,Bobopod Airport CBC Tangerang,"akhirnya mencoba bobobox. ke sini karena ada flight pagi ke padang di soekarno hatta setelah landing dari bali. jadi memang cari yang praktis saja penginapannya. bisa disimpulkan selama 1 malam di sini:  pro: - murah - praktis - nyaman dan bersih banget kamar & toilet - staf ramah  cons: - susah cari gelas. pas kesana, cuman ada 1 gelas bersih doang yang mana enggak boleh bawa gelas ke kamar jadi aku kalau haus bolak balik.

Bonjour Amira!,1.0,"I stayed for 3 nights at Bobobox Alun-alun Bandung. On the first night there was no problem. The location is very strategic and the facilities are quite adequate. The only downside is that it does not provide a parking lot for cars or motorbikes, so customers who bring vehicles are required to park elsewhere which requires additional costs. However, on the second night, Bobobox received a study tour group from a company from Bukittinggi which was very noisy and disturbed other Bobobox guests! I couldn't sleep all night because of the noise. I have reprimanded the noisy students but they were ignored. When I complained to the security guard and receptionist, they agreed, but until 10 pm no one had reprimanded the guests. Maybe in the future the receptionist and security guard can be more assertive in managing noisy and disturbing guests, considering that Bobobox itself already has a quiet hours policy from 21.00-07.00. but in reality, when there are noisy and disturbing guests during those quiet hours, no one at bobobox can take firm steps to reprimand them. even though there are other guests who also need time to rest in peace.",6 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Bandung,"saya menginap selama 3 malam di bobobox alun-alun bandung. pada malam pertama tidak ada masalah. lokasinya sangat strategis dan fasilitas cukup memadai. minusnya hanya tidak menyediakan tempat parkir baik untuk mobil ataupun motor, sehingga pelanggan yang membawa kendaraan diharuskan untuk parkir di tempat lain yang mana harus mengeluarkan biaya lagi.  namun pada malam kedua, pihak bobobox kedatangan rombongan study tour dari sebuah sama dari bukittinggi yang mana sangat-sangat berisik dan mengganggu tamu-tamu bobobox lain! saya tidak bisa tidur semalaman karena berisik.  saya sudah menegur siswa-siswa yang berisik tersebut namun tidak dihiraukan. saat saya komplain ke satpam dan resepsionis mereka mengiyakan namun hingga jam 10 malam lebih tidak ada yang menegur tamu-tamu tersebut. mungkin untuk ke depannya resepsionis dan satpam dapat lebih tegas dalam mengatur tamu-tamu yang berisik dan mengganggu, mengingat bobobox sendiri sudah memiliki kebijakan quiet hours dari jam 21.00-07.00. namun pada kenyataannya, saat ada tamu yang berisik dan mengganggu pada quiet hours tersebut, tidak ada satu pun pihak bobobox yang dapat mengambil langkah tegas untuk menegur. padahal ada tamu-tamu lain yang juga butuh waktu untuk istirahat dengan tenang."

Fikri Rachmad Ardi,4.0,"Who is the target market for bobobox pods? Maybe this is suitable if you: - travel alone, but have minimal clothes - bring work - don't want to bother with breakfast and have to go to the next place immediately, this place is suitable for you who have conditions like this. even though you have to compromise on the size of the room, hehehe, it's extraordinarily sufficient. the plus point is, the rooftop where you work is your friend to accompany you to do your work. food, water, all free as long as you wash your clothes. the internet is too fast on this rooftop, so you can focus more on work without being hit by cafe operating hours. I personally like the service, especially the staff who are willing to help guests who are confused about how to open a room or set the room lights. very detailed and understandable. the room around the pods also seems simple and not too bombastic like other hotels, even though you have to provide your own entertainment because the pods are too small, hehehe. what needs to be noted, this place doesn't have breakfast, but because it's located in the heart of the town square, it's too much if you forget to have breakfast around here. everything is delicious. Overall, if you want to focus on yourself for your assignment but are in Bandung, this is the right place to go.",6 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Bandung,"siapa target market bobobox pods ini? mungkin ini cocok kalau kamu: - travel sendiri, tapi baju minim - lagi bawa pekerjaan - enggak mau ribet sama sarapan dan harus segera ke tempat selanjutnya  tempat ini cocok buatmu yang punya kondisi seperti ini. walau harus kompromi sama ukuran kamarnya yang, hehehe, ini luar biasa cukup.  nilai plusnya, rooftop tempat kamu bekerja adalah temanmu menemani mengerjakan tugas. akat makan, air, gratis semua selama kamu cuci ya. internet terlalu kencang di rooftop ini, jadi kamu bisa lebih fokus kerja tanpa kepentok jam operasional kafe.  saya sendi4i suka dengan pelayanannya, terutama stafnya yang mau membantu tamunya yang kebingungan dengan cara buka kamar atau menyeting lampu ruangannya. sangat detail dan dapat dipahami. ruangan di sekitar podsnya pun terkesan simpel dan enggak terlalu bombastis seperti hotel lain, ya walau harus modal entertainment sendiri karena podsnya kekecilan, hehehe.  yang perlu diperhatikan, tempat ini tidak ada sarapan, tapi karena lokasinya di jantung alun-alun, kebangetan kalau kamu lupa sarapan di sekitar sini. enak-enak semua kok.  overall, kalau kamu lagi pengin fokus sendiri buat nugas tapi lagi di bandung, sudah paling benar ke sini."

Shofia Chairani,1.0,"I always trust the matter of staying at bobobox because my experience is always satisfied but when I tried it in the bandung town square, the level of cleanliness was very uncomfortable, especially the toilet. It was dirty, rusty and many were broken as if it had never been cleaned, there was a lot of dirt, the soap and shampoo holders were broken, the sink was rusty, hot water was not ready in the women's toilet on the 3rd floor, the toilet was also dirty so it turned yellow, the bed sheets were dirty, I entered the room and saw brown dirt on several points on the mattress, the sandal locker no. 17 was broken even though when it was broken I had complained to the waiter, he said he would fix it but in fact it wasn't, and the worst thing is that the parking is private so visitors have to pay according to the hours, there is no cooperation with the related building so visitors have to pay for their respective vehicles even though bobobox always cooperates with the building regarding parking so visitors don't lose money, at the beginning of the complaint, he said that later a solution would be given for the parking problem so I thought it was safe regarding costs but when checking out the officer said that there had been no cooperation with the building for a long time. for in the bandung town square I was very disappointed because there were so many spots that seemed to have never been cleaned at all here in the bandung town square there were many people staying so when taking a shower there was a queue. I got a pod on the 2nd floor but because there were so many people queuing I ended up taking a shower on the 3rd floor, in my experience, I never queued because it was that comfortable at bobobox but when the facilities were not up to par I was put off from staying at bobobox bandung town square again",7 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Bandung,"saya selalu mempercayakan soal nginap menginap di bobobox karena pengalaman saya selalu puas namun ketika saya coba di alun alun bandung itu untuk tingkat kebersihan itu sangat amat tidak nyaman terutama toilet. dia kotor, karatan dan banyak yang rusak seperti tidak pernah dibersihkan, banyak kotoran tempat sabun dan shampoo rusak, wastafel karatan, air hangat tidak ready di loilet perempuan lantai 3, toilet nya pun banyak kotoran wc sehingga jadi kuning sprai kasur banyak kotoran, saya masuk kamar sudah melihat kotoran coklat di beberapa titik kasur, loker sendal no 17 rusak padahal ketika rusak saya sempat mengadu ke pelayannya katanya mau dibenerin tapi nyatanya tidak, dan parahnya untuk parkir itu pribadi jadi pengunjung harus bayar sesuai jam, tidak ada kerja sama dengan gedung terkait jadi pengunjung harus bayar kendaraannya masing² padahal bobobox itu selalu ada kerja sama dengan gedung masalah parkir jadi pengunjung pun tidak tekor biaya, di awal mengadu pun katanya nanti dikasih solusi untuk masalah parkir jadi saya kira aman masalah biaya tapi ketika check out petugasnya bilang sudah lama tidak ada kerja sama dengan gedung. untuk di alun-alun bandung ini saya sangat kecewa karena banyak sekali spot yang sepertinya tidak pernah dibersihkan sama sekali  disini di alun alun bandung itu banyak yang menginap jadi ketika mandi pun itu antri. saya dapat pods di lantai 2 namun karena antri yang begitu banyak orang akhirnya saya mandi di lantai 3, se pengalaman saya, saya tidak pernah mengantri karena memang senyaman itu di bobobox tapi ketika fasilitasnya tidak sesuai saya kapok untuk menginap lagi di bobobox alun alun bandung"

Hadian Alkani,4.0,"had the opportunity to stay for 4 nights here, what I liked about this hotel is that it is cheap, clean according to bobobox standards, hot water in the bathroom is safe, cold air conditioning (using central air conditioning) & the wifi is really fast up to 400mbps. the downside for bobobox alun alun is that the lift is broken, many have complained about the same thing (has it been broken for a long time and not been fixed?) even though to access food and prayer you have to go to the rooftop (4th floor), then the parking lot is separate from the bobobox building and quite a walk (several reviews complain about the parking), the room is not soundproof so if you get noisy neighbors, it's not peaceful. then will I stay again? of course if the budget is thin under 200 thousand per night I would prefer bobobox than a conventional hotel, but if the price goes up above 200, it's better to go to a conventional hotel. additional note for those of you who are quite plump (nope) and are old like me, it is not recommended to choose a pod that is sky (above) it goes up quite high, be aware that it is for young people 😁",a year,Bobopod Alun Alun Bandung,"berkesempatan untuk long stay 4 malam disini, yang disukai dari hotel ini murah, bersih sesuai standar bobobox, air panas kamar mandi aman, ac dingin (menggunakan ac central) & wifi nya kencang parah up to 400mbps sih. kekurangannya untuk bobobox alun-alun liftnya rusak, banyak yang komplain serupa (apa sudah lama rusak dan tidak dibenerin?) padahal untuk akses makan dan shalat harus ke rooftop (lantai 4), lalu parkiran terpisah dari bangunan bobobox dan lumayan jalan (beberapa review komplain soal parkiran), kamar tidak kedap suara ya jadi kalau zonk dapat tetangga berisik ya enggak tenang.  lalu apakah saya akan menginap kembali? tentu jika budgetnya tipis dibawah 200rbu per malam saya akan lebih memilih bobobox daripada hotel konvensional, tapi kalau harganya naik diatas 200an ya mending ke hotel konvensional saja sih.  catatan tambahan buat anda yang cukup berisi (enggak*uk) dan sudah tua seperti saya tidak disarankan memilih pod yang sky (diatas) naiknya cukup tinggi, sadar diri itu untuk anak muda 😁"

Indi Sugar Taufik,3.0,"On September 2, 2022, I ordered 2 pods for me, my husband, my father, and a 6-year-old child. It was quite a pleasant experience, but I think there are things that need to be considered and can be improved. I will mention the shortcomings first: 1. Not child-friendly. Even though it only takes a small space for a mini playground. It can be placed in a common space, such as a rooftop. 2. Not disabled-friendly. This is what bothers me the most. The elevator is very small and only goes to the 3rd floor. Then you can only use steep stairs. So if you or want to invite your friends/family who use wheelchairs, forget it. 4. The wifi is very weak. 5. Lack of cleanliness. There are clumps of hair in the corner (in the corner of the bed). It was cleaned immediately after I reported it. how to clean it the staff climbs onto the bed that has been fitted with sheets, -I feel less hygienic :( 6. the size of the blanket is too small for two people to use. 7. for snacks can only be purchased with a digital wallet (such as ovo, etc.). less practical especially for my father's age who does not have an application like that. 8. access to enter the pod must use a cellphone. meaning that when going to the bathroom the cellphone must be brought, unless there is someone else who can open the pod door from the inside. feels like carrying germs :( even so there are things that I give a thumbs up to from bobobox: 1. all employees are friendly. even the security. they are also helpful and patient. 2. the bathroom facilities are quite clean. sometimes there are tissues scattered but after I check a few hours later it is clean. 3. the location is close to the mall and supermarket. 4. not too crowded even on weekends. my suggestion is that bobobox can be more ""friendly"" to all groups. there is no prohibition on the elderly, children and disabilities to stay there, right? everyone is allowed to have the experience of staying in a capsule hotel. so think again about accessibility. for room door access maybe it can be replaced with access card. cell phone models nowadays are big. it feels annoying to have to bring cell phone just to pee :/ thank you.",a year,Bobopod Alun Alun Bandung,"tanggal 2 september 2022 lalu aku memesan 2 pods untuk aku, suami, bapak dan satu anak usia 6 tahun. pengalaman yang cukup menyenangkan tapi kupikir ada hal-hal yang harus jadi perhatian dan bisa diimprove.  aku akan sebutkan kekurangannya dulu: 1. tidak ramah anak. padahal hanya perlu space kecil untuk playground mini. bisa ditaruh di common space, misalnya rooftop. 2. tidak ramah disabilitas. ini yang paling menggangguku. elevator sangat kecil dan hanya sampai lantai 3. selanjutnya hanya bisa menggunakan tangga yang terjal. jadi jika anda atau ingin mengajak teman/kelurga anda yang menggunakan kursi roda, lupakan saja. 4. wifi sangat lemah. 5. kebersihan kurang. ada gumpalan rambut di pojokan (di sudut tempat tidur). langsung dibersihkan setelah aku lapor. cara membersihkannya petugas naik ke atas tempat tidur yang sudah terpasang sprai, -aku merasa kurang hygiene :( 6. ukuran selimut terlalu kecil untuk dipakai berdua. 7. untuk snacks hanya bisa dibeli dengan dompet digital (seperti ovo, dll). kurang praktis terutama untuk seusia bapakku yang tidak punya aplikasi seperti itu. 8. akses masuk pod harus menggunakan hp. artinya saat ke kamar mandi pun hp harus dibawa, kecuali ada orang lain yang bisa membuka pintu pod dari dalam. berasa bawa-bawa kuman :(  meski begitu ada hal-hal yang aku ancungi jempol dari bobobox: 1. seluruh karyawannya ramah. bahkan securitynya. mereka juga helpful dan sabar. 2. fasilitas kamar mandi cukup bersih. terkadang ada tisu berceceran tapi setelah kucek beberapa jam kemudian sudah bersih. 3. lokasi dekat dengan mall dan supermarket. 4. tidak terlalu ramai meski akhir pekan.  saranku agar bobobox bisa lebih ""ramah"" untuk semua kalangan. tidak ada larangan orang tua, anak-anak dan disabilitas untuk menginap di sana kan? semua orang boleh punya pengalaman menginap di hotel kapsul. jadi pikirkan kembali aksesibilitasnya. untuk akses pintu kamar mungkin bisa diganti dengan kartu akses. model hp sekarang besar-besar. risih rasanya harus membawa hp untuk sekedar buang air kecil : /  terima kasih."

Han Ah Ya,3.0,"according to this cave is the best in Bandung. in terms of location is really strategic. The rooftop is also very nice if you hang out at night, eat, or just relax here.  but I don't understand if the staff has a problem. I want to go back to the checkout, but I pray first on the 4th floor. So if you go from the 1st to 3rd floor, take the elevator, if you go from 3rd to 4th, go up the steep stairs. I went from the 4th floor mosque up the stairs with a lot of luggage and went down to the 3rd floor. to the 2nd floor first take the shoes from the locker, well on the 2nd floor we wait for the elevator to the 1st floor because the conditions are very stuffy going down the stairs, and there is a lot of luggage. just waiting for the staff to ask, ""do you want to check out? just go through here"" to which he pointed to the stairs. I'm confused, he asked because he thought I didn't know what to check out or expel, right? My friend laughed and didn't want to go down the stairs because the elevator had already reached our floor.  Please help me if you think I should rush home, that's not the way. rude boss! just check the cctv, why am I in the room? We finished praying from the 4th floor. Don't you like it when guests take the elevator? yes, just turn it off, don't work at all. strange fig. make the memory bad by staying there.",a year,Bobopod Alun Alun Bandung,"menurut gua ini yang paling bagus di bandung. dari segi lokasi benar-benar strategis. rooftop nya juga enak banget kalo malam buat nongkrong, makan, atau santai saja disini.  tapi enggak mengerti staffnya ada masalah apaya. gua mau balik cekout tapi solat dulu di lantai 4. jadi kalo dari lantai 1 sampai 3 naik lift kalo 3 ke 4 naik tangga yang curam ya. gua dari musolah lantaii 4 naik tangga dengan barang bawaan yang banyak turun lantai 3 sudah ngap. ke lantai 2 dulu ambil sepatu di loker, nah di lantai 2 kami menunggu lift ke lantai 1 karena kondisi ngap banget turun tangga, dan barang bawaan banyak. pas lagi menunggu staffnya bertanya, ""mau cekout? lewat sini saja"" yang mana dia nunjuk tangga. kayak gua binggung, dia tuh bertanya karena merasa gua enggak tau cek out apa ngusir ya? teman gua kekeh enggak mau turun tangga karena lift pun sudah sampai di lantai kami.  tolong lah kalo perkara lu merasa gua harus buru2 pulang, ya enggak begitu caranya. enggak sopan bos! cek saja cctv, apa gua di kamar apa mengapai. kami tuh habis solat dari lantai 4.  apa kalian enggak suka kalo tamu naik lift? ya matiin saja, jangan berfungsi sekalian. aneh anjir. bikin jelek memori nginep disitu saja."

Eva Anggreani,5.0,"the location is in the same building as the post office, which is near the Malang city square. because it is located there, the position is very strategic if you need various things. the big market is close, Kajoetangan is close, the station is also close. moreover, in the same area as the post office, there is a kind of food court (basically a place to eat), so if you are hungry you don't have to go far. for the service, I arrived at the location at around 12, and it turned out that I couldn't check this in. but you can leave your stuff, and you have to fill out a stuff storage form which states that if something goes missing, it is not Bobopod's responsibility, something like that when I arrived at 2, there were a lot of people who wanted to check this in. where there were also problems with the application, and there was only one officer handling the check in 😱, even though it was busy. maybe if you want to check in at this time, there will be more officers. but other than that, the service is okay. for the cleanliness of the bedrooms, shared bathrooms, it's pretty good. because it is cleaned regularly, if there is a bed that runs out, it is immediately refilled. and for the toilets and bathrooms, there are many. so there is no such thing as queuing hehe. a prayer room has also been provided. gallon water is also provided in several places, so those who want to refill their drinking bottles are welcome to. don't forget, there is a communal area that directly faces the Malang city square. and most importantly, the room is not soundproof, whatever you do in the room, can be heard in the next pod (especially the one above/below). remember, anything can be heard, ytta. conclusion, I was quite happy during my stay at this bobopod.",3 days,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"lokasinya satu bangunan dengan kantor pos, yang dekat alun2 kota malang. karena letaknya di situ, posisinya strategis sekali kalo lagi butuh macam-macam. ke pasar besar dekat, kajoetangan dekat, stasiun termasuk dekat juga. apalagi dalam satu lingkungan kantor pos itu, ada semacam pujasera (pokoknya tempat makan deh), jadi kalo laper enggak perlu jauh2. untuk layanan, saya sampai di lokasi jam 12-an begitu, dan ternyata belum bisa check ini. tapi bisa titip barang, dan harus mengisi formulir penitipan barang yang isinya itu menyatakan kalo terjadi kehilangan maka hal tersebut bukan tanggung jawab nya bobopod, semacam begitu deh pas jam 2 saya datang, malah numpuk yang pada mau check ini. mana ada juga yang bermasalah aplikasinya, dan petugas yang nge-handle check ini cuma satu orang 😱, padahal lagi rame loh. mungkin kalo mau jam check ini, petugasnya ditambahin kali ya. tapi selain itu, layanannya oke kok.  untuk kebersihan kamar tidur, kamar mandi bersama, cukup oke kok. karena rutin dibersihkan, kalo ada tidur yang habis segera diisi ulang. dan untuk toilet dan kamar mandi nya, banyak. jadi enggak ada itu yang namanya antri hehe. mushola pun sudah disediakan. air galon pun disediakan di beberapa tempat, jadi yang mau refill botol minum boleh banget. jangan lupa, ada communal area yang menghadap langsung ke alun2 kota malang.  dan yang paling penting, kamarnya ini enggak kedap suara, apapun yang kalian lakukan di dalam kamar, bisa terdengar ke pod sebelah (terutama yang atas/bawah). ingat ya, apapun bisa kedengaran loh, ytta.  kesimpulan, saya cukup senang selama menginap di bobopod ini."

elok farida,4.0,"the location is very strategic in the southern square of Malang. Below there is a food court, mixue and many street vendors too. the atmosphere is lively but the noise outside does not enter the pod area. it's just that from the hallway to the pod the sound does enter. so people's footsteps, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of neighbors above, beside, in front of the pod who are chatting or listening to music can be heard in our pod. but because I'm not the type who is not too sensitive to sounds when sleeping so it's still comfortable enough for me to stay in this bobopod. I got a price of 150 thousand for a pod with a capacity of 2 people including breakfast/sahur for two people. the menu is uduk rice/yellow rice. but because I was solo traveling and happened to have dinner late so when sahur I didn't take the food because I was still full and a bit lazy to go out to eat to the communal room. oh yeah, it is allowed to bring food to the pod only to be stored. it is not allowed to be eaten in the pod. food can be eaten in the communal room. the space is quite spacious and clean.",3 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"lokasinya strategis banget di alun-alun selatan malang. dibawah ada food court, mixue dan banyak pedagang kaki lima juga. suasananya ramai tapi kebisingan diluar tidak sampai masuk ke area pod. hanya saja memang dari lorong ke pod suaranya masuk. jadi langkah kaki orang, suara buka tutup pintu dan suara tetangga atas, samping, depan pod yang sedang mengobrol atau mendengarkan musik sampai terdengar ke pod kita. tapi karena saya bukan tipe yang tidak terlalu sensitif dengan suara suara saat tidur jadi masih cukup nyaman untuk saya menginap di bobopod ini. saya dapat harga 150 ribuan untuk pod kapasitas 2 orang sudah include sarapan/sahur untuk dua orang. menunya nasi uduk/nasi kuning. tapi karena saya solo traveling dan kebetulan makan malamnya terlambat jadi saat sahur tidak ambil makanannya karena masih kenyang dan agak malas keluar untuk makan menuju ke ruang komunal. oh iya, diperbolehkan membawa makanan ke pod hanya untuk disimpan saja. tidak boleh dimakan di dalam pod. makanan bisa dimakan di ruang komunal. space cukup luas dan bersih."

Arif Abdiansah,1.0,"250 price hotel can sleep in a box, 😂😂 if it's an experience it's ok, but for that price in Indonesia there are many better hotels where you can get a room, especially here in Malang, many 3 star hotels are also available, let alone reddorz class and the like, remember that those who want Quality rest, don't stay at this hotel, why?  there are many kinds of guests who will accompany you in the dorm, typically there is noise until dawn, the sound of people passing by, the sound of doors opening and closing that sometimes don't make any noise at all, 😂😂 if I make 250, I'd better choose a hotel that has a real room , wkwkwkwkw",4 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"hotel harga 250 dapat tidur di box, 😂😂 kalo buat pengalaman ok, tapi harga segitu di indonesia banyak hotel2 yang lebih baik dpet perkamar, terutama ini di malang banyak hotel bintang 3 juga deh dpet, apalagi sekelas reddorz dan sejenisnya, ingat ya yang pengin istrahat berkualitas jangan nginep di hotel beginian, karena apa?  banyak macam tamu yang bakalan menemani kalian se dorm itu, typikal berisik sampai subuh pun ada, suara lalu lalang orang-orang, suara pintu buka tutup yang kadang enggak ngotakk sama sekali berisiknya, 😂😂 kalo saya buat 250 mending pilih hotel yang dpet kamar benaran, wkwkwkwkw"

Pypy,2.0,"want to try how it feels to sleep in a capsule hotel. turns out the first experience was quite traumatic for me. and finally decided to just do it once. after reading the review I was prepared for the noise of the street near the town square. but it turned out I was noisy with the neighbor in front of the room who was still chatting until 2.30 am. like literally chatting in a normal voice, even though there is a quiet hour from 9 pm - 7 am. his little child was screaming incoherently. then the guest in the pod below kept opening and closing the door randomly, and maybe there was interference with the plug making it really noisy. I was so disturbed that I chatted the host 2x, called, and reprimanded him directly, but it still didn't work. the build quality of this pod is also not that soundproof. suggestions: - bobopod must make strict rules about this. don't ignore the rights of other residents to rest. there could be a rule that if you are noisy, you will be evicted if you are reprimanded 3 times. - don't accept guests who bring toddlers or family groups. - security guards and/or other employees should not smoke at the entrance. really disturbing.",5 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"mau mencoba bagaimana sih rasanya tidur di hotel kapsul. ternyata pengalaman pertama cukup traumatik buat saya. dan akhirnya memutuskan cukup sekali saja.  setelah baca review saya memang sudah prepared ut kebisingan jalanan yang dekat dengan alun2. tapi ternyata saya kebrisikan dengan tetangga depan kamar yang sampai jam 2.30 pagi masih mengobrol. like literally mengobrol dengan suara normal, padahal ada jam tenang 9 malam - 7 pagi. anaknya yang kecil teriak2 enggak karuan. sudah begitu tamu di pod bawah bolak balik buka tutup pintu ngasal, dan mungkin ada gangguan sama colokannya bikin berisik banget ampun.  saking terganggunya saya sampai 2x chat host, telpon, dan tegur langsung, tetap enggak ngaruh.  kualitas built ini pod nya juga enggak begitu kedap sih.  saran: - bobopod musti buat aturan tegas soal ini. jangan mengabaikan hak penghuni lain untuk beristirahat. bisa saja ada aturan yang berisik, kena tegur 3x langsung diusir. - jangan terima tamu yang bawa toddler atau rombongan keluarga. - satpam dan atau karyawan lain jangan merokok dipintu masuk. ganggu banget."
Heyou Nuka,5.0,"- strategic, lots of snacks, 2 days here I'm full where the food is sold and cheap, and I like it - I won't get dehydrated because of the dispensers everywhere - the hot water in the shower is a bit lacking because the water suddenly gets cold when I take a shower or it's suddenly very hot wkwk - the communal area is wide and there are many benches where you can eat while watching people's activities in the malang square - breakfast from 7 to 10 am - everything is scanned, where do you have to bring your phone because you use your phone to scan - when you say don't be too loud in the pod, it will be noisy later it sounds like a neighbor - the officers are all responsive and responsive, everything is set - if you bring a vehicle, you can park for free, just ask the receptionist for a stamp, there is also storage for helmets, I will tell you later - if you bake bread, don't take too long, don't wait until you get up to the top, later it will be burnt - after using the plates or cutlery, try washing them yourself, it's too lazy to see people who have used them just put them in the sink or who have eaten their food waste and leave it on the table even though there are many trash cans everywhere. hey wkwk - there is a musholla, the toilet is also separate for girls and boys so it's safe, the closet and shower are separate but please dong those who use the toilet really pay attention to it until it's clean before leaving, it's the same if you use a hair dryer and your hair continues to fall out, don't even throw your hair in the sink yes 🫠 - to be honest, there are a lot of rules here that are in English, so maybe a lot of people don't understand, so there are some that are violated, like putting sandals on the shoe rack when entering the toilet, but of course you can ask the staff if you don't understand 👌 - to be honest, the pictures of people on the wall startled me from the start, especially when I went to the toilet alone in the middle of the night, it was like I suddenly saw someone standing and got scared - the coffee to go device is cool and more automatic than what I found at bobobox jakarta 👍🏻",5 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"- strategis banyak jajanan, 2 hari disini kenyang di mana2 jualan makanan dan murah2 enak lagi aku suka - enggak akan dehidrasi karena dispenser di mana2 - air panas di shower agak kureng karena pas lagi mandi air tiba-tiba dingin atau nanti tiba-tiba panas banget wkwk - communal area nya luas dan banyak bangku nya bisa makan sambil lihat orang-orang activity di alun2 malang - breakfast dari jam 7 sampai 10 pagi - serba scan, kemana2 harus bawa hp karena scan2 pakai hp - mengomong jangan kenceng2 di pod, berisik nanti kedengaran sama tetangga - pegawai semua responsif dan tanggap, sat set - kalau bawa kendaraan bisa free parking, tinggal meminta stempel di receptionist, ada storage buat helm juga nanti bilang sama bapak security - kalau panggang roti jangan lama-lama, jangan menunggu sampai teng naik ke atas, nanti gosong - habis pakai piring atau alat makan coba di cuci mandiri ya, malas banget lihat orang yang habis pakai cuma di taro di wastafel atau yang habis makan sampah makanannya di biarkan saja di atas meja padahal tong sampah banyak di mana2 mager banget sih wkwk - ada musholla, toilet juga pisah cewek cowok jadi aman, closet dan shower terpisah tapi tolong dong yang pakai toilet benar-benar di perhatikan sampai bersih baru keluar, sama kalau habis pakai hair dryer terus rambutnya rontok jangan malah rambutnya di buang di wastafel atuh 🫠 - sejujur nya banyak banget peraturan di sini yang berbahasa inggris jadi mungkin banyak yang tidak mengerti ya sehingga ada beberapa yang di langgar, seperti meletakkan sendal di rak sepatu ketika sedang memasuki toilet, namun tentu nya sangat bisa bertanya kepada para staff jika tidak mengerti 👌 - jujur sih gambar orang-orang di tembok itu awal-awal ngagetin aku apalagi pas tengah malam ke toilet sendiri sepi, kayak tiba-tiba lihat ada orang berdiri jadi takut - alat coffee to go nya keren lebih otomatis dari yang aku temui di bobobox jakarta 👍🏻"

Felia Nuvria Sari,5.0,"tips: 1. choose the bottom pod type / earth double because the size is quite spacious and you don't have to climb first every time you want to rest. 2. even though there is a blanket, bring a jacket because inside the pod it is always closed and the AC control doesn't really give an impact. 3. because the barcode can't be ss and all access must open the app, sometimes it takes quite a long time to load, prefer taking photos using another cellphone then save the gallery. or immediately open the barcode before in front of the door because it makes others queue. honest review: facilities 5/5 each pod gives the best impression with its sophisticated features, the toilet is always clean even though it is shared, there is also a refill of drinking water, a complete prayer room with prayer mats, sarongs and a place for ablution. service 5/5 staff are friendly, patient, responsive, and very kind helpfully comfort 4/5 the mattress is quite hard but so far I can still sleep, the AC is still very cold even though the control above is closed, and there is quite noise between the sky and earth pods.",5 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"tips : 1. pilih tipe pod yang bawah /earth yang double karena ukuran cukup luas dan enggak harus manjat dulu tiap mau istirahat. 2. meskipun ada selimut, bawa jaket karena di dalem pod yang selalu tertutup dan kontrol ac yang enggak begitu kasih impact. 3. karena barcode enggak bisa di ss dan segala akses harus buka apk, kadang cukup lama saat load prefer foto pakai ponsel lain lalu save galeri. atau segera buka brcode sebelum di depan pintu karena cukup bikin antri yang lain.  honest review:  fasilitas 5/5 setiap pod memberi kesan terbaik dengan fitur canggihnya, toilet selalu bersih meskipun sharing, ada refill air putih juga, mushola lengkap dengan mukena sajadah sarung dan tempat wudhu.  layanan 5/5 staff ramah, sabar, tanggap, dan baik banget helpfully  kenyamanan 4/5 kasur memang lumayan keras tapi so far masih bisa tidur, ac tetap dingin parah meskipun kontrol di atas sudah ditutup ,dan cukup noise antar pod sky dengan earth."

Donny Sabri Ashari,5.0,"first experience staying at a capsule hotel. even though my body is wide, it's not difficult to get into a single bed room, hehe. oh yes, there is a gallon of water in the communal room which is fun for eating and chatting, but at that time it's still nugas xixixi 😅.  make you sleep very comfortable and during sleep you are not disturbed by noise from outside because the room is soundproof. every time in the hotel area you must bring your phone to scan the barcode, it might be a bit complicated because if you bring a lot of stuff you have to open your phone first.  because the toilet does not have a bidet hose, so it is quite difficult to clean areas that are not accessible. towels and toothbrushes are available for showering, at first I thought there was no hot water, but it turned out that there was eventually showering often and I didn't worry about wet hair because there was a hair dryer.  whenever I'm unlucky, I'll choose bobobox again. oh yes, I got a bobocabin voucher at checkout, but unfortunately I haven't had a chance to go there yet.",11 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"pengalaman pertama nginep di hotel kapsul. walaupun badan saya lebar tapi masuk ke kamar single bed enggak kesusahan kok gaes, hehe. oh iya ada air galon di ruang komunal yang asyik buat makan dan mengobrol ria, tapi waktu itu lagi nugas sih xixixi 😅.  buat tidur nyaman banget dan selama tidur tidak terganggu sama suara dari luar karena kamar kedap suara. tiap di area hotel wajib bawa hp buat scan barcode, mungkin agak ribet karena kalo bawa barang banyak harus buka hp dulu.  buat wcnya tidak tersedia selang bidet, jadi agak kesusahan buat membersihkan area yang tidak terjangkau. tersedia handuk dan sikat gigi buat mandi, awalnya ngira enggak ada air hangat, eh ternyata ada akhirnya sering mandi dan enggak khawatir sama rambut basah karena ada hair dryer.  kapan-kapan kalo ke malang bakal memilih bobobox lagi deh. oh iya dapat voucher bobocabin pas checkout, cuma sayang belum berkesempatan kesana."

Monica Graselia,3.0,"It's my first time staying at bobobox, the room is small but nice too, my advice is to take the one above, because if the one below, I'm afraid it's as noisy as the one above and you can clearly hear people's footsteps. the bathroom is nice, clean, and there are many so no need to queue. only the hair dryer likes to die after using it for a few minutes. very good location, right across malang square in the city center, close to everywhere. the bed is comfortable too.  What I don't like here the most is, it's noisy. the voices of people outside talking, walking, dragging suitcases, opening and closing doors, are very audible, and their voices are very loud. I can't sleep here, because when I want to sleep there is always a sound, even though it is written quiet time, but it doesn't affect the guests there, no one complains either. let alone open and close the door, it's very noisy, it should be like a bobobox, the door doesn't make noise when it's closed and opened, it's very loud even slowly, the door is still noisy, brak brak brak brak it sounds like it's being slammed, buset, how do you want to sleep. where 1 room, all the capsule rooms combined, there are 60s, everything that opens and closes the door is very noisy. It should be separated per room like other hostels, so everything is not too noisy.",11 months,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"baru pertama kali nginap di bobobox, kamar nya kecil tapi enak juga, saran saya ambil yang diatas, karena kalau yang dibawah, takutnya berisik sama yang diatas dan terdengar jelas tapak kaki orang-orang. kamar mandinya bagus, bersih, dan ada banyak jadi enggak perlu antri. cuma hair dryer nya suka mati baru dipakai beberapa menit. lokasi bagus banget, persis di seberang alun-alun malang di pusat kota, kemana-mana dekat. tempat tidur nyaman juga.  yang saya paling enggak suka disini adalah, berisik. suara orang di luar yang berbicara, berjalan, geret koper, buka-tutup pintu, kedengaran banget, dan suara nya kencang banget. saya enggak bisa tidur disini, karena baru mau tidur selalu saja ada suara, padahal sudah ditulis quiet time, tapi enggak ngaruh tuh sama tamu disana, enggak ada yang negur juga. apalagi buka tutup pintu nya, berisik banget, harusnya sekelas bobobox, pintu nya enggak berisik pas ditutup dan dibuka, ini kencang banget bahkan sudah pelan-pelan, pintunya tetap berisik, brak brak brak brak suaranya kayak dibanting, buset, bagaimana mau tidur. mana 1 ruangan semua kamar kapsul digabung ada 60-an, semua yang buka tutup pintu berisik banget jadinya. harusnya dipisah begitu per kamar kayak hostel lain, jadi enggak terlalu berisik semuanya."

Febi A,5.0,"I stayed here for only 1 night. Starting from the service, room cleanliness, toilet, everything is good. Strategic location, right near Malang square and close to the station too. There is an outdoor space, with a view facing the square. There are many seats, plugs, and a pantry if you want to make hot water or need plates/glasses. Bobobox Malang branch only has 1 floor, different from the one in Yogyakarta which at that time I remember had 3 floors. But its ok, no problem. In addition, there are free drinking water facilities, 3 gallons are available in 3 different places. In my opinion, the only minus of staying at Bobobox is 1, namely the problem of the room air conditioner being too cold, the temperature cannot be increased. Moreover, Malang is cold, added to the cold room temperature too. Wow, double kill, it feels really cold, especially in the early hours of the morning. But overall is good, worth it. according to the price. There is a price for appearance. Thank you Bobobox 😃",a year,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"saya menginap disini hanya 1 malam. mulai dari pelayanan, kebersihan kamar, toilet,  semuanya bagus. lokasi strategis, pas didekat alun-alun malang sama dekat dengan stasiun juga. ada ruang outdoornya, dengan view yang menghadap alun-alun. tersedia banyak tempat duduk, colokan, dan pantry apabila ingin membuat air panas atau membutuhkan piring/gelas.  bobobox cabang malang hanya memiliki 1 lantai, beda dengan yang di yogyakarta yang sptnya saat itu seingat saya ada 3 lantai. tapi its ok, no problem. selain itu, ada fasilitas air minum gratis, tersedia 3 galon yang berada di 3 tempat yang berbeda. kalo menurut saya minusnya menginap di bobobox itu hanya 1 yaitu masalah ac kamar yang terlalu dingin, suhu tidak bisa dinaikkan. apalagi malang dingin, ketambahan sama suhu kamar yang dingin juga. wow, double kill, dingin banget rasanya, terutama saat dini hari menjelang pagi.  but overall is good, worth it. sesuai dengan harganya. ada harga ada rupa. terima kasih bobobox 😃"

meeya sabrina,4.0,"we stayed here because my son wanted to experience staying in a capsule hotel, the location and service are good, a step away from the town square and the mixue shop, close to mcd, dunkin donuts, and gramedia, also close to the oen shop, the grand mosque, and the church which are usually tourist destinations, around the hotel there are many food stalls and street vendors, the room, hmm, as a capsule hotel, with a shared bathroom and toilet, it's like getting the experience of staying in a hostel and a hotel at the same time, the atmosphere in the room is like being on a ferry, but actually with that price (idr 292k) you can stay in a budget hotel chain with an en-suite bathroom, then what's a bit annoying, there's no retractable bidet spray in the toilet, the bidet that sprays onto the she late, so in the men's toilet some of the cubicles smell of urine, hopefully it can be a concern for the management, thank goodness you and the women's toilet are clean, yes it's too much for women if they're dirty, the facilities are sufficient, there are two towels in the room, but for other amenities you have to buy them at the reception, in the bathroom there is one hairdryer, then there is a prayer room, a kitchen with a microwave, and a dishwashing area with soap always available, the hotel door and sandal locker can be opened using a QR code from the Bobobox application, the communal space faces directly onto the road and playground in the town square, spending Saturday night sitting in the communal space while drinking canned coffee bought at the reception and eating popmie that can be cooked in the microwave, omg it's a pleasure in itself.",a year,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"kami menginap disini karena anak saya ingin merasakan pengalaman menginap di hotel kapsul,  lokasi dan pelayanan baik, selangkah dari alun2 dan toko mixue, dekat dengan mcd, dunkin donut, dan gramedia, dekat pula dengan toko oen, masjid agung, dan gereja yang biasa menjadi destinasi wisata, di sekitar hotel terdapat banyak warung makan dan pedagang keliling,  kamarnya, hmm, sebagai sebuah hotel kapsul, dengan kamar mandi dan wc bersama, seakan2 mendapatkan pengalaman menginap di hostel dan hotel sekaligus, suasana di kamar seperti didalam kapal feri, tapi sebenarnya dengan harga segitu (idr 292k) sudah bisa menginap di jaringan hotel budget dengan kamar mandi dalam, kemudian yang agak menyebalkan, di wc tidak ada bidet semprot yang bisa ditarik, bidetnya yang pakem nyemprot ke she late itu loh, sehingga di wc pria beberapa biliknya ada yang berbau pesing, semoga bisa menjadi perhatian bagi management, syukurlah kamu dan wc wanita bersih, ya kebangetan sih cewe2 kalo jorok,  fasilitasnya cukup, tersedia dua handuk di kamar, namun untuk amenities lainnya harus membeli di resepsionis, di kamar mandi ada satu hairdryer, kemudian ada musholla, dapur dengan satu microwave, dan tempat cuci piring yang sabunnya selalu tersedia, pintu hotel dan loker sendal dibuka dengan menggunakan qr code dari aplikasi bobobox,  comunal spacenya menghadap langsung ke jalan dan playground di alun2, menghabiskan malam minggu duduk di komunal space sambil minum kopi kaleng yang dibeli di resepsionis dan makan popmie yang bisa dimasak di microwave, omg sebuah kesenangan tersendiri."

Rezki Anisa,5.0,"stayed here alone for 3 days 2 nights for a vacation (took a sky pod) and was really satisfied. 1. the staff are all friendly, informative and very fast. from the security guards downstairs to the ones upstairs are all the same. 2. the cleanliness is also really clean, whether inside the pod or in the public area. there is a little dirt but it is caused by naughty guests (don't want to throw trash in the bin, hair stains in the sink near the hairdryer are not cleaned), but the staff is quick to clean it. 3. the facilities are complete. prayer room with mukena and prayer mat, bathroom with separate toilet and shower cubicles, refillable gallon, dishwashing area, water heater and microwave, soap & shampoo that doesn't dry out your hair. if you are hungry or want to buy toiletries, you can buy them next to the receptionist. 4. the bathroom between cubicles is separated not only by glass (my experience staying in other capsule hotels, between cubicles is only separated by glass so it feels like there is less privacy and you guys and girls are together), the glass is only on the bathroom cubicle door. There is a cloth partition between the shower and the changing area. more comfortable privacy. Oh yes, the men's and women's bathrooms are separated. So you can relax and open the hijab while drying your hair. 5. I asked if I could invite my friends into the communal area (the area where you can sit and relax and eat), it turned out you were allowed, they even gave them slippers so they didn't slip.  In conclusion, for traveling alone, Bobobox is the right choice. walk alone but don't feel alone. comfortable and feel safe here. like at home. really suitable for a staycation when you're tired of work.  It's also possible for families, yesterday I saw a young couple and their crucian carp.",2 years,Bobopod Alun Alun Malang,"nginep disini sendiri 3 hari 2 malam buat liburan (ambil sky pod) dan benar-benar puas.  1. staffnya semuanya ramah, informatif dan gercep banget. dari mulai satpam di bawah sampai yang diatas sama semua. 2. kebersihannya juga benar-benar bersih, entah di dalem pod atau di area publik. ada sih kotoran dikit tapi disebabkan pengunjung yang bandel (enggak mau buang sampah ke tempatnya, bekas rambut di wastafel dekat hairdryer enggak dibersihin), tapi staffnya gercep buat bersihin. 3. fasilitasnya lengkap. mushola dengan mukena dan sajadah, kamar mandi dengan wc dan shower terpisah bilik, galon isi ulang, tempat cuci piring, water heater dan microwave, sabun & sampo yang enggak bikin rambut kering. kalo laper atau beli perlengkapan mandi bisa dibeli di sebelah resepsionis. 4. kamar mandinya antar biliknya dipisah enggak hanya dari kaca (pengalaman nginep di hotel kapsul lain, antar bilik cuman dibatasin kaca jadi kayak kurang privasi dan kamu cowok cewek gabung), kaca hanya dibagian pintu bilik kamar mandi. terus antara shower dan tempat ganti baju diberi sekat kain. makin nyaman privasinya. oh iya kamar mandi cowok dan cewek dipisah. jadi bisa santai buka hijab sambil ngeringin rambut. 5. pernah bertanya boleh ajak teman masuk ke area komunal (area duduk duduk santai & makan), ternyata boleh, malah dikasih sandal juga biar enggak nyeker.  kesimpulannya, buat traveling sendiri bobobox pilihan yang tepat. jalan sendiri tapi enggak merasa sendiri. nyaman dan merasa aman disini. kayak di rumah sendiri. cocok banget buat staycation kalp penat kerja wkwk.  buat keluarga juga bisa, kemarin lihat ada pasangan muda dan krucilnya."

The sound of people snoring is really audible, especially in one box above and below 😂",a year,Bobopod Cipaganti Bandung,"overall, ya mayanlah sesuai harga. box ini sebenarnya solusi kalau mau murah simple.  plus: bersih, tempat tidur cukup untuk satu orang, bantal empuk, lampu bisa di adjust, toilet bersih, rapi. area of improvement: kasur tipis kurang nyaman, tangga buat naik ke kasur yang sky minggir banget susah lebih baik tangga langsung yang step ditengah jangan jadi lemari, saran juga ada kursi ditempat loker sepatu. suara orang ngorok kedengaran banget apalagi yang satu box atas bawah 😂"

Lexi,2.0,"had a really unpleasant stay here. luckily only 1 night. 1. the prayer room is quite far from the room. just imagine having to go down first at dawn to pray. 2. the AC is not cold, plus the room is small so it is very stuffy. complained to the front desk, told to wait 1-2 hours because they said ""it just turned on"". it should have been turned on a few hours before check-in time, what's wrong.. then after waiting, it was still stuffy. complained again. the receptionist was different, and she said the dial on the ceiling had to be turned on. the question is: why did the previous statement differ? then when a technician came to the pods to plug in, asked about the AC. eh he said it just turned on because there had been repairs lol different people have different reasons 3. the power outlet in the pods didn't work. it connected, but didn't increase the percentage. when I complained, it turned out there was trouble, the technician had rebooted it but it still didn't work. finally advised to move pods. went down to the front desk, it turned out I couldn't move pods, the reason was that the single one had been sold out. okay fine, what if I just upgrade to double? I can't do that either. Had to re-book and no refund because I had already checked in😂 hahaha peak comedy.  4. The toilet is quite clean even though there is yellow crust. I don't know about the shower yet.  5.

I complained to the receptionist, but she said ""the email is there, but it didn't enter the bobobox system"". So what's wrong with me? And I asked for another room, there wasn't one. Is it because I booked during an epic sale that my room was being ignored? The hotel easily filed for a refund, but what I needed was a room to rest. I had traveled far from home intending to go on vacation but instead became annoyed by this incident! If you really don't intend to provide a ""cheap"" room, it's better not to participate in promo events than to invite bad reviews from customers. I will never stay at bobobox again.

Kurniawan Adi Widodo,5.0,"first experience staying at a hotel with the capsule concept. The hotel is the same as Nyland Hotel, so from the street, the sign is less visible.  Overall, it's good enough for a place to rest or just transit, because if you're in the quiet hour, from 21.00 - 07.00, you can't be noisy, the problem is that the pod is not soundproof, so if it's noisy, it will definitely disturb the neighbors. if you still want to chat, you can chat in the middle room.  eating and drinking is also prohibited inside the pod so that the cleanliness of the pod is always maintained. if you want to eat or drink you can in the middle room, there is a table and chairs. shoes/sandals must also be replaced with hotel sandals if you want to enter the pod area, which are available in the lockers of each pod.  what's unique is the pod/room key. modern concept so use qr code. The qr code to enter the main door is the same as entering each pod, so it's definitely safe guys. The most troublesome thing is, wherever you go, you automatically have to bring your gadget/smartphone, because the QR code is in the bobobox application. there are people who take the initiative to screenshoot the qr, then print it. Yes, I have to find a photocopy first huhuhu~ fyi, for the single and double pods here, the ones in Paskal look like they are only doubles. I don't know if it's in Dago.",4 years,Bobopod Cipaganti Bandung,"pengalaman pertama nginep di hotel dengan konsep capsule. hotelnya jadi satu sama nyland hotel jadi kalo dari jalanan kurang begitu terlihat plangnya sih bob.  overall lumayan lah untuk buat tempat istirahat atau sekedar transit, karena kalo sudah masuk quiet hour, dari jam 21.00 - 07.00, enggak boleh berisik, soalnya pod nya enggak kedap suara, jadi kalo berisik pasti ganggu tetangga. kalo masih mau mengobrol mengobrol bisa di ruang tengah.  makan dan minum juga dilarang di dalam pod agar kebersihan pod selalu terjaga. kalo mau makan atau minum bisa di ruang tengah, ada meja kursi. sepatu/sandal juga harus diganti dengan sandal hotel kalo mau masuk kawasan pod, yang tersedia di loker masing-masing pod.  yang unik itu kunci pod/kamarnya. konsep kekinian jadi pakai qr code. qr codenya buat masuk pintu utama sama buat masuk pod masing-masing, jadi sudah pasti aman guys. paling yang rada repot itu, kemana mana otomatis harus bawa gadget/smartphone, karena qr nya ada di aplikasi boboboxnya. ada sih yang inisiatif screenshoot qrnya, terus di print. ya kali mesti mencari fotokopian dulu huhuhu~  fyi, buat yang single dan double pod adanya disini, yang di paskal kalo dilihat cuma double saja kayaknya. enggak tau kalo yang di dago."

The strategic location is very close if you want to go up to Lembang, close to Jalan Dipatiukur, so finding food or laundry is easy. The rooms are clean and smell minty so the air conditioner isn't cold enough, even though it's fully opened. the toilet vent is quite clean, the staff cleans it every day, the soap is always full, unfortunately the hairdryer in the men's toilet is dead, the dining room is quite clean, there is an outdoor microwave, I think you have to wipe it often, because when I wanted to use it there were traces of sticky cheese. The trash can in the dining room also needs to be added, because it is often overloaded.  others, one of the plus points at Bobobox Dago is that there is parking and security so motorbikes/cars are safe in the lobby, lots of chairs for sitting too.",2 years,Bobopod Dago Bandung,"saya nginap disini selama 6 hari dan jenis pod yang saya pilih itu sky double  lokasi strategis banget dekat kalau mau naik ke lembang dekat sama jalan dipatiukur, jadi cari makan atau laundry gampang  kamar kamarnya bersih dan wangi mint2 begitu acnya kurang dingin, padahal sudah dibuka penuh ventnya  toilet toiletnya cukup bersih dibersihin sama petugasnya setiap hari sabun selalu full sayangnya hairdryer di toilet cowok mati  ruang makan ruang makan lumayan bersih ada outdoornya microwave nya harus sering-sering di lap kayaknya, soalnya pada saat saya mau pakai ada bekas keju lengket begitu. tempat sampah di ruang makan juga harus di tambah, karena sering overload.  others salah satu nilai plus di bobobox dago ini itu ada tempat parkir dan security jadi motor/mobil aman  di lobby banyak kursi juga buat duduk2"

That's the point of the note.  for the bathroom there are many, so don't be afraid to queue for a long time, and there is also hot water which is important and there is also a hairdryer. well good! one more thing, the bathroom and toilet are separate, so it's safe👌 the car park can fit 4 cars if I'm not mistaken, forget it. for the cleanliness in each lane is very good. The room is also clean and fragrant, because it is forbidden to bring food into the room. 👌 sometimes it's not nice to receive a phone call in the room so it's like an auto whispering, because it's like we're afraid of disturbing those above or below us. oia same, there are no drinking utensils, so bring a tumblr, they only provide water in gallons.",2 years,Bobopod Dago Bandung,"pertama kali banget mencoba menginap di bobobox, ternyata seru ya. meskipun rada ribet karena untuk mengakses kamar harus menggunakan aplikasi. sebenarnya fine fine saja kalau kalian hpnya enggak bermasalah, kalau kalian hpnya sering ngehang, dan kalo pas mau masuk kamar ternyata hp kalian low batt, yaudah wassalam harus ngecharge dulu. disitu saja sih poin catatannya.  untuk kamar mandinya banyak, jadi jangan takut buat lama antri, dan juga ada air panasnya yang terpenting dan juga ada hairdryer. well good! satu lagi, kamar mandi dan toiletnya terpisah, jadi aman👌  parkiran mobil bisa buat 4 mobil kalau enggak salah, lupa. untuk kebersihan di setiap lorong oke banget. kamar juga bersih wangi, karena di larang bawa makanan ke dalam kamar. 👌  palingan enggak enaknya kalau menerima telfon di kamar jadi kayak auto bisik2 mengomongnya, soalnya kayak takut ngeganggu yang di atas atau di bawah kita. oia sama ini, enggak ada alat minum, jadi bawa tumblr, mereka cuma sediain air di galon saja."

I usually book directly through the bobobox application.. it's easy and there are lots of discounts.. the cheapest price I've ever gotten for single pods is 64k.. always choose the sky type pods.. but if you bring children, I think it's better to choose the earth one, because the sky one is quite high to climb to the bed.. I've also tried the bobobox in Alun-alun Bandung.. but the one in Dago is the best in my opinion.. because the room doesn't smell like the bobobox in Alun-alun Bandung.. the bathroom is shared, but clean, there is soap, shampoo and hairdryer.. there is a dispenser & microwave in the dining room.. perfect for making popmie.. towels are also available.. for toothbrushes & toothpaste, you can request them from the employees / you can also request them from the application.. it will be delivered to your room for free.. 👍",2 years,Bobopod Dago Bandung,"kalau mau menginap disini lebih baik memesan 1 minggu sebelum.. saya biasanya langsung memesan lewat aplikasi bobobox.. mudah dan banyak diskon nya.. harga termurah yang pernah saya dapat untuk pods single itu di 64k.. selalu memilih pods tipe sky.. tapi kalau mengajak anak-anak menurut saya lebih baik memilih yang earth, karena yang sky lumayan tinggi untuk naik ketempat tdrnya.. saya pernah juga mencoba bobobox yang di alun2 bandung.. tapi memang yang di dago yang paling ok menurut saya.. karena kamarnya tidak berbau seperti di bobobox alun2.. kamar mandi bersama, tapi bersih, ada sabun, sampo dan hairdryer.. di ruang makan tersedia dispenser & mikrowave.. pas banget buat bikin popmie.. sudah tersedia handuk juga.. untuk sikat gigi & odol bisa request ke karyawannya / bisa juga request dari aplikasinya.. nanti diantar ke kamar gratis.. 👍"

I can't sleep at all.. for the pocket-friendly price, just to stay.. but the air tightness of the room is less.. I also think the room is not too cold..",2 months,Bobopod ITC Kuningan,"coba nginep disini 1 hari saja.. saya dan keluarga dapat room agak dalam nomor 57.. room oke ada ambient lampu yang bisa di setup, ada default lagu relaxing buat tidur, bisa connect bluetooth ke handphone kalau mau setel musik dari handphone.. kamar rapi bersih.. toilet sharing bersih, cuma pas nginep ada bau pesing dan nemu tisu di dalam kloset wanitanya.. kebersihan toilet kayaknya depends juga sama yang nginep orgnya jorok apa enggak.. disini ada quiet time di jam 21.00-07.00.. tapi waktu nginep, jam 00.40an depan kamar setel lagu beat (lagu tembus ke kamar) dan bagian balik kamar tempat kita menginap (ruangan lain) ada cewek mengobrol ketawa2 dari jam 9 malam sampai jam 2 pagi enggak berenti2 nembus bok ke kamar.. enggak bisa tidur sama sekali.. untuk price ramah dikantong, buat sekadar nginep.. tapi kekedapan ruangan kurang.. menurutku juga kamarnya enggak terlalu dingin.."

Nadia,5.0,"this is my second stay ini bobobox, but my first time staying at this branch. it was located beside mal ambasador and it has a private entrance. it’s a bit hard to navigate, honestly, because the point on google maps is not necessarily accurate (it was ini the lobby of itc kuningan. if you follow this, you need to go to the side lobby of itc, cross the street to mal ambasador until you find a baca office, then it is located just right around the corner of the office).  after the check-ini, we were asked to change our shoes into their sandals (the only footwear allowed inside the pods area). the room was perfectly neat and comfortable. although the single room is not that suffocating (there’s more tahan enough room to move), i highly recommend it to stay at the double room. you only need to pay an additional rp50,000 per night, then you can have much more comfort! it’s worth it, trust me!  the bathroom and toilet are shared and located at the end of the hallways. it was well-maintained and every time i went there, it was always clean. they also provide free water refill (please bring your own water bottle) and free breakfast until 9 sama. i found no notable thing to complain about during my stay.  compared to the services they provide, their price is crazy cheap! another plus point is that this branch is located strategically ini the middle of kuningan. you can walk to kuningan city, lotte mall kuningan, etc.  pro tip: request a pod between the numbers 3-6 because these pods get sunlight during the day and have such an amazing view ini night!",3 months,Bobopod ITC Kuningan,"this is my second stay ini bobobox, but my first time staying at this branch. it was located beside mal ambasador and it has a private entrance. it’s a bit hard to navigate, honestly, because the point on google maps is not necessarily accurate (it was ini the lobby of itc kuningan. if you follow this, you need to go to the side lobby of itc, cross the street to mal ambasador until you find a baca office, then it is located just right around the corner of the office).  after the check-ini, we were asked to change our shoes into their sandals (the only footwear allowed inside the pods area). the room was perfectly neat and comfortable. although the single room is not that suffocating (there’s more tahan enough room to move), i highly recommend it to stay at the double room. you only need to pay an additional rp50,000 per night, then you can have much more comfort! it’s worth it, trust me!  the bathroom and toilet are shared and located at the end of the hallways. it was well-maintained and every time i went there, it was always clean. they also provide free water refill (please bring your own water bottle) and free breakfast until 9 sama. i found no notable thing to complain about during my stay.  compared to the services they provide, their price is crazy cheap! another plus point is that this branch is located strategically ini the middle of kuningan. you can walk to kuningan city, lotte mall kuningan, etc.  pro tip: request a pod between the numbers 3-6 because these pods get sunlight during the day and have such an amazing view ini night!"

Diah Kusumaningrum,4.0,"Bobobox is suitable for those who stop by because it is in the shape of pods and the rooms are also comfortable. Access can be via the mall or the bobobox lift behind the mall ambassador. Toiletries are available, provided in the bathroom for soap and shampoo. You can also get soap in the room and in the lobby you can get a toothbrush & toothpaste and a cup. In the hallway there is a dispenser for drinking refills, the AC is in cold pods and the bathroom can be arranged to be clean, there is a hair dryer, separate shower and toilet.  In my opinion, there are two things that are lacking, the room is not soundproof because if someone is chatting in the next room and there are people walking in the hallway, you can still hear the staff cleaning the female bathroom, preferably female staff too because it wasn't comfortable yesterday when I wanted to use the toilet at the same time as the male staff. who cleans the toilets, and the staff knows someone wants to use the toilet so they don't come out of there first, so they don't use the toilet in the end",5 months,Bobopod ITC Kuningan,"bobobox cocok buat yang singgah karena bentuknya pods dan kamarnya juga nyaman. aksesnya bisa lewat dalam mall atau lift bobobox dibelakang mall ambasador. toiletries sudah dapat, disediakan di kamar mandi untuk sabun sekaligus shampoo. di kamar juga dapat sabun dan di lobby bisa ambil sikat & pasta gigi serta cup. di lorong disediakan dispenser untuk refill minum acnya di dalam pods dingin dan bisa diatur kamar mandi bersih, ada hair dryer, shower dan toilet kepisah.  yang kurang menurutku ada dua, ruangan kurang kedap suara karena kalau kamar sebelah ada yang mengobrol dan ada orang jalan di lorong masih kedengaran terus untuk staf yang membersihkan kamar mandi wanita sebaiknya staf wanita juga karena enggak nyaman ajan kemarin waktu mau pakai toilet bersamaan dengan staf laki² yang bersihin toilet, dan stafnya tau ada yang mau pakai toilet dia enggak keluar dulu dari sana, enggak jadi pakai toilet deh akhirnya"

The security and parking attendants also don't know where the exact place is. ran out of time to find a parking lot n location on the 4th floor of itc kuningan. for smokers it's also a bit complicated because they have to go out of the mall to whip.

Hari,4.0,"bobopod by bobobox is indeed a very futuristic accommodation. everything uses the same application. So even though you have booked on another application, you still have to install your own application. Why? so you can check in and check out. Access using the barcode in the application. want to go in and out of the room and access using a barcode. This means you have to carry your cellphone everywhere. which is quite complicated, open the cellphone then open the application then open the barcode. because the bedroom is not soundproof at all so you will definitely hear the sound of chatting, footsteps or even just moving on the bed. It's suitable for backpackers. sleep well too. There are 3 toilets, 3 showers for men and women. there is a prayer room and a place to eat but I couldn't find what was said to be the 2nd floor. I don't know where to enter 😪 that's all for now.",a month,Bobopod Kebayoran Baru Jakarta,"bobopod by bobobox ini memang penginapan yang terlalu futuristic. semuanya serba pakai aplikasi begitu. jadi walaupun sudah booking di aplikasi lain tetap harus install aplikasi sendiri. kenapa? biar bisa check-ini dan check-out. akses pakai barcode yang ada di aplikasi. mau keluar masuk ruangan dan akses pakai barcode. artinya harus bawa hp kemana-mana. which is lumayan meribetkan sih, buka hp lalu buka aplikasi lalu buka barcode. karena ruangan tempat tidurnya yang enggak kedap suara sama sekali jadi memang pasti bakal kedengaran suara mengobrol, langkah kaki atau bahkan hanya bergerak di kasur. cocok sih untuk yang backpacker-an. tidur juga nyenyak kok. toilet ada 3, tempat mandi 3 masing masing laki dan perempuan. ada mushola sama tempat makan tapi aku enggak nemu yang katanya lantai 2. entah masuk lewat mana 😪 sekian dulu deh."
Titania Dhea R,5.0,"actually intentionally stayed here because I already know what the quality of bobobox is like, and especially its cleanliness. so far there are no problems with the room, service etc. the bathroom is clean there is a water heater, clean toilet, there are lockers, there is an elevator, water refill is provided, there is a microwave, cutlery, and a prayer room too. the place is not too far from the same block mrt, but the parking is quite limited, but it's okay because I use public transportation. but there are some notes that need to be considered in bobobox kebayoran baru. first, the glasses provided are actually clean, but because they are rarely deep cleaned, there are many coffee or tea stains that can actually be cleaned if cleaned using stainless steel fibers. maybe it can be considered to deep clean the glasses, btw I didn't use the plates so I don't know the condition. second, it seems like I got a towel that ""slightly smells"" whether it's because the towel was in the box's sleeping room for too long, or it wasn't a towel that had just been washed, I don't really understand, what's clear is that it smells unpleasant. third, I didn't get a toothbrush haha, but it's okay, towels are a bit crucial in my opinion. luckily I brought my own towel. so far everything is okay, but indeed at every door access you have to use a barcode, so you have to be ready to bring your cellphone. the room is very technology-based, I like it. oh yeah, the only minus is that the prayer room is only on the 1st floor, so because I got it on the 2nd floor, I was a bit lazy if I had to go down the stairs, so I just prayed in my room. for cleanliness, it needs to be improved, but I'm satisfied with all the services and facilities provided.",a month,Bobopod Kebayoran Baru Jakarta,"sebenarnya sengaja nginep disini karena sudah tau kualitas bobobox seperti apa, dan terutama kebersihannya. so far tidak ada masalah dengan kamar, pelayanan dll. kamar mandi bersih ada water heater, toilet bersih, ada loker, ada lift, water refill disediakan, ada microwave, alat alat makan, mushola juga. tempatnya enggak terlalu jauh dari mrt blok sama, tapi memang parkir nya cukup terbatas, tapi it's ok karena saya pengguna transportasi public. tapi perlu beberapa notes yang perlu diperhatikan di bobobox kebayoran baru.  pertama, gelas yang disediakan sebenarnya bersih, tapi karena jarang di deep cleanse, ada banyak noda bekas kopi atau teh yang sebenarnya bisa bersih kalo dibersihkan menggunakan serabut stainless steel. mungkin bisa dibuat pertimbangan untuk deep cleanse gelas, btw saya enggak pakai piring nya jadi enggak tau kondisinya.  kedua, kayaknya saya dapat handuk yang ""agak bau"" entah faktor handuknya terlalu lama di ruangan tidur box nya, atau memang bukan handuk yang baru banget di cuci, saya juga kurang paham, yang jelas berbau kurang mengenakkan.  ketiga, saya enggak dapat sikat gigi haha, tapi gapapa kok it's ok, handuk sih agak krusial menurut saya. untung bawa handuk pribadi.  so far sih semuanya ok, tapi memang di setiap akses pintu harus pakai barcode, jadi harus standby bawa hp. room nya based on technology banget lah ya suka sih. oh iya minusnya paling mushola hanya ada di lantai 1, jadi karena dapat nya di lantai 2, agak mager kalo harus turun tangga, jadinya sholat di kamar saja.  untuk kebersihannya ditingkatkan lagi ya, tapi puas kok dengan semua layanan dan fasilitas yang disediakan."

The layout of this bobobox is not symmetrical left and right, so we had to pass the sink and toilet before entering the room, which is kinda uncomfortable for some people because they have to smell the food when passing from the entrance to the room.",7 months,Bobopod Kebayoran Baru Jakarta,"+ kamar rapi seperti bobobox pada umumnya. + layanan oke, ada parkiran yang ada di bawah basement bank danamon (punya bobobox), satpam juga sigap 24 jam untuk bantu buka tutup kapanpun. + lokasi pinggir jalan as always, menyenangkan.  bobobox ini terdiri dari 4 lantai berbeda, jadi harus ada extra effort untuk naik lift dan tangga ke atas ke tempat-tempat yang berbeda-beda, antara mushalla dan tempat makan.  layout dari bobobox ini enggak simetris kiri kanan, jadi kita sempat ngelewatin wastafel dan toilet dulu sebelum masuk ke kamar, which is kinda kurang nyaman for some people karena harus mencium bau makanan ketika lalu lalang dari entrance ke kamar."
Osman Nur Chaidir,5.0,"A good budget hotel, both in terms of service and physical appearance. The rooms are clean, cool, and suitable if you only want to sleep. However, facilities such as a drinking water dispenser that is always full, free breakfast bread in the pantry on the 2nd floor, and bathroom soap that is always full make staying here feel like staying at home. There is a chat feature on the responsive application, so when we need anything, just chat via the application. Snacks, instant food are ready on the ground floor. Location? Yes, it's really great, just walk a little, there are food stalls in Sambas, it only takes 5-10 minutes to enjoy Gultik Blok Sama, along with very affordable transportation access. The downside is that the parking lot tends to be narrow. However, the security guard is very helpful. Plus, you are in Jakarta, so you don't need to worry too much about vehicles because public transportation accessibility is very good. Overall, for a solo trip in Jakarta, it is very likely for me to stay here again. Please maintain the quality of service and facilities.",8 months,Bobopod Kebayoran Baru Jakarta,"hotel budget yang oke, baik dari segi pelayanannya maupun fisiknya.  kamarnya bersih, adem, dan cocok jika hanya bertujuan untuk tidur saja. namun, fasilitas seperti dispenser air minum yang selalu penuh, free breakfast roti di pantry lantai 2, hingga sabun kamar mandi yang selalu penuh membuat menginap di sini serasa menginap di rumah.  ada fitur chat di aplikasi yang responsif, sehingga ketika kita butuh apa-apa, langsung chat saja via aplikasi tersebut. snack, makanan instan ready di lantai dasar. lokasi? ya top banget, jalan sedikit sudah ada lapak makanan di sambas, hanya butuh waktu berjalan 5-10 menit untuk menikmati gultik blok sama, beserta akses transportasi yang sangat terjangkau.  kekurangannya, memang tempat parkir yang cenderung sempit. namun, satpam sangat solutif. plus, anda di jakarta, jadi tidak perlu terlalu risau terkait kendaraan karena aksesibilitas transportasi umum sangat baik.  overall, untuk perjalanan solo di jakarta, sangat besar kemungkinan bagi saya untuk menginap di sini kembali. please tetap jaga kualitas pelayanan dan fasilitasnya ya"

Bobobox's technology is also very updated. because starting from this check to check out, use a gadget. open the door, scan the barcode. turn off the lights, use gadgets too. so inside the box we can arrange for lighting, music and ac.

Rizky D. Novyantika,3.0,"1. cleanliness: this is indeed a budget hotel, which is indeed cheap, but it's really like no one cleans. maybe there are those who clean but who are not as diligent as that, the feeling is that the girls' bathroom and toilet are not used by many, but for 3 days and 2 nights, the tissues are not cleaned until they go out. like a lot of leftover hair too. apart from that, just like other reviews, the bedspread has spots and spots like that.  2. less practical: because if you don't have the bobobox application, you have to register first so you can enter the room, enter the room using the qr that is in the application. so where should you take your cell phone, if you leave it behind it becomes more complicated. apart from that, the app registration has to be verified by the ktp and the selfie too *it's almost complicated to imagine if you have a long trip to take a break, it's even more complicated to register the application and have to verify it as well.  3. The officers are not friendly either.  4. The sound is not muted so it's true, if we stay and upstairs/downstairs we chat, you can hear them talking because it's not soundproofed at all.  other than that, I give 3 stars because it's still good and the price is cheap, but like you've been given a toothbrush, there's soap, the shower water can be hot/cold, and a towel is also provided (even though the towel has stains too) so it's better to bring your own towel.",a year,Bobopod Kebayoran Baru Jakarta,"1. kebersihan : memang ini budget hotel yang notabene memang harganya murah, tapi benar-benar deh kayak enggak ada yang ngebersihin. mungkin ada yang ngebersihin tapi yang enggak serajin itu, perasaan kamar mandi dan toilet cewek tuh enggak banyak yang pakai tapi selama 3 hari 2 malam kayak tissuenya enggak di bersih bersihin sampai keluar keluar. kayak banyak sisa sisa rambut juga. selain itu, sama kayak review lainnya seprainya itu ada bercak bercaknya begitu.  2. kurang praktis : karenaaa kalo belum punya aplikasi bobobox harus daftar daftar dulu supaya bisa masuk kamar, masuk kamarnya itu pakai qr yang ada didalam aplikasi tersebut. jadi kemana mana harus bawa hp, kalo ketinggalan jadi ribet lagi. selain itu pendaftaran appsnya harus sampai verifikasi ktp dan selfie juga *meh ribet terbayang kan kalo habis jauh perjalanan mau istirahat malah ribet ribet daftar aplikasi dan sampai harus verifikasi juga.  3. kurang ramah pegawainya juga kurang ramah sih.  4. enggak redam suara jadi benar, kalo kita nginep dan atas/bawah kita mengobrol tuh bisa kedengaran mereka ngobrolin apaan saking enggak kedap suara sama sekali.  selain itu, aku kasih bintang 3 karena masih lumayan selain harganya murah ya tapi kayak sudah dikasih sikat gigi, sudah ada sabun, air showernya bisa panas/dingin sama disediain anduk juga (walaupun anduknya ada bercaknya juga) jadi better tetap bawa anduk sendiri ya."

Zahra Tri Hapshari Chalim (Sarah),4.0,"in 2019 when it opened, if I'm not mistaken, I've stayed once and I'll stay again twice. the difference is noticeable, and the effect of the pandemic. from checkin time, there is a pause because the staff is on break so wait. if you want to sit outside near the security guard. because the lobby has drink and snack machines. plus, you can go cashless without having to go to the minimarket. if you bring a motorbike, the security guard will direct you to the basement parking lot, it's safe. car? Yes, it is enough to park 2 cars because the land is minimal. It's good to stay here near the food court, it's enough to walk to the same block. ok continue to the pods, hm don't like to be honest, the sheets are dull. towels are in the pods, yes. For those who are confused, why is there no mineral water, Bobo prepared a dispenser as well. this is more economical hehe. the glass? ask the checkin staff. the kitchen only has an oven. The note for the oven should be checked, maybe it's rarely used so it's dirty like that. if it's cutlery, just ask, because it's about buying food online. take a toothbrush at checkin, all vitamins are free hehe. The bottom line is that if you go to sleep, you don't have to worry about toiletries like towels, soap, shampoo are available. just bring a change of clothes. for eating sitting there is on the 2nd floor, yes, the 3rd floor seems to be there too, the 1st floor only has 2 benches because they were given a pod on the 1st floor😑. used to be flip-flops, now it's like very thin hotel slippers😭.

Annisa Zulfa Hidayah,5.0,"the rooms are comfortable, good for looking for a unique staying experience in a box. It's also sophisticated because you can control the room light from your cellphone and there are room speakers that can be connected via Bluetooth. The downside may be that the room is small so there is no place to pray, you have to pray in the prayer room but there is only 1 in the building. A suggestion might be to make prayer rooms on every floor. then to enter the room and mobilize inside the building you need to use a barcode. It's a bit complicated because you have to hold your cellphone everywhere (if you leave the cellphone with the barcode in the room it could get messy), if the cellphone dies it's also complicated. Then maybe the rules that are a bit burdensome are that you can't eat in your room and you can't make noise because you can hear it from outside. but overall good service, clean.",3 years,Bobopod Kebayoran Baru Jakarta,"kamarnya nyaman, bagus buat mencari pengalaman menginap yang unik di dalam box. canggih juga karena bisa mengatur cahaya kamar dari hp dan ada speaker kamar yang bisa diconnect lewat bluetooth. kekurangannya mungkin karena kamarnya kecil jadi enggak ada tempat sholat, sholatnya harus di mushola tapi cuma ada 1 di dalam 1 gedung. saran mungkin bisa dibuat mushola di setiap lantai. lalu untuk masuk kamar dan mobilisasi di dalam gedung perlu pakai barcode. agak ribet karena harus memegang hp kemana2 (kalo hp yang ada barcodenya ketinggalan di dalem kamar bisa berabe), kalo hp mati juga ribet. terus mungkin peraturan yang agak memberatkan adalah enggak boleh makan di dalem kamar dan enggak bisa berisik karena bisa kedengaran dari luar. tapi overall pelayanan bagus, bersih."

Where do you buy the mineral water? Is there really no quantity control?  for the security guards who look after the motorcycle parking, don't like to ask motorists for parking tips.  I really asked him to volunteer, just a bit nervous.  if you want to love, you will definitely be given.  it's just that if you ask, it feels a bit uncomfortable.. I had a chance to check out at 6:15 a.m. the gate wasn't open yet so I couldn't go out and luckily there was a guard at the entrance of Bobobox who helped open it if I couldn't, I was late and I was checked in too 😭 Yes, the shampoo/soap bottle because one of the bottles gets stuck and won't release the gel, the one I tried on the 2nd floor is the same if you can change the hot water outlet model if you can, because the hot water comes out a bit strange so the hot water comes out the cold water is gone, or the cold water is suddenly hot.

Nanda A,5.0,"finally tried sleeping in the bobobox! the capsule concept is quite limited in movement, you can't do somersaults inside the room 🙂 the location is quite strategic, close to staiun kai, not far from malls (paragon and dp). if it's crowded at night, because it's a tourist area, to be able to sleep in bobobox, you must have the application. because access to the room and room uses a barcode scan in the application. I took the sky single room, the bed is enough for 1 person, the mattress position is on top. The first time I entered was a bit awkward because the fren was also sophisticated 👍🏻 just need to scan, the door can be opened. when the door is closed, it automatically locks. there is AC, there is a wooden shelf to put things, there is a multi-functional charger plug. I thought it could only be the one with 3 legs, it turns out that Indonesian plugs can generally also go in :"") there is a b-pad like a smart tool to set the mood/color and light intensity of the lamp, it can be set through the application as well. You can set the music so it's like in river or forest. If you want to set your own music, there is a lobby as well as a place to hang out. There is a mosque, and there is a separate bathroom for girls and boys . for the toilet, there is a locker to keep the shoes/sandals. The receptionist is always smiling when I enter the room. everyone is welcoming and so helping Ndeso customers like me 🌝 don't take too long, please try bobo at bobobox, with that price (which is written on the application) it's worth it! thank you, old city bobobox!",8 months,Bobopod Kota Lama Semarang,"akhirnya mencoba tidur di bobobox! konsep kapsul yang cukup terbatas geraknya, enggak bisa salto di dalem kamar 🙂  lokasi cukup strategis, dekat dengan staiun kai, enggak jauh-jauh sekali dengan mall (paragon dan dp). kalau malam rame, karena kawasan wisata  room untuk bisa bobo di bobobox, kudu punya aplikasinya. karena akses keluar masuk ruang dan kamar pakai scan barcode di aplikasi. aku ambil room yang sky single, tempat tidurnya cukup buat 1 orang, posisi kasur ada di atas. pertama masuk agak ndeso karena canggih juga fren 👍🏻 tinggal scan, pintu bisa dibuka. pas pintu ditutup, otomatis lock (kunci). ada ac, ada rak kayu untuk menaruh barang, ada colokan charger yang multifungsi. aku pikir cuma bisa yang kakinya 3, ternyata colokan indonesia pada umumnya juga bisa masuk :"") ada b-pad macam smart tools isinya untuk atur mood/warna dan intensitas cahaya lampu, bisa diatur lewat aplikasinya juga. bisa setting musik biar kayak lagi di sungai atau hutan. bisa sambungin ke bluetooth kalau mau setel musiknya sendiri  fasilitas pertama masuk ada lobby sekaligus tempat nongkrong. ada mini kitchen begitu kali ya, disediakan gelas, dispenser, dan microwave. ada mushola, ada kamar mandi bersama yang tentunya dipisah cewek dan cowok. untuk wc pakenya wc duduk fren. ada loker untuk simpan sepatu/sandal. room selalu bersih, kamar mandi juga. resepsionis 24 jam!  pelayanan cukup top! masnya senyum terus. mau mas2 yang di resepsionis maupun yang aku temui pas mau masuk room, semua menyambut hangat dan so helping pelanggan ndeso macam aku nih 🌝  tidak usah terlalu panjang, silakan mencoba bobo di bobobox, dengan harga segitu (yang tertera di aplikasi) it's worth it! terima kasih, bobobox kota lama!"

Fahmi Prayoga,5.0,"a place to stay that carries a different concept from the others. comfortable for a double bed size because it can be a bit spacious. while for a single size in my opinion it is a bit too small. especially for those carrying quite a lot of luggage. the atmosphere of sleeping in a 'box' is indeed different. comfortable. there are various kinds of ambience light atmospheres that can be adjusted to taste. backsound water or birds can also be included in the box. very strategic location because it is right in the middle of the old city of Semarang which is one of the tourist areas in Semarang. good service. footwear is safe because there is a storage box that will be exchanged for special footwear in the bobobox area. bathrooms and toilets are not enough indeed. but if at a moment that is not crowded like a long weekend, it is also not too much of a problem with this. or you can trick it by taking a shower early and the like. really cool.",11 months,Bobopod Kota Lama Semarang,tempat penginapan yang mengusung konsep berbeda dengan yang lain. nyaman untuk ukuran double bed karena bisa agak luas. sementara untuk ukuran single menurut saya agak terlalu kecil. utamanya bagi pembawa barang yang cukup banyak. suasana tidur dalam 'box' memang berbeda. nyaman. ada berbagai macam suasana ambience light yang dapat disesuaikan dengan selera. backsound air ataupun burung juga dapat disertakan dalam box. sangat strategis letaknya karena benar-benar di tengah-tengah dari kota lama semarang yang menjadi salah satu area wisata di semarang. pelayanan bagus. alas kaki aman karena ada box penyimpanan yang akan ditukar dengan alas kaki khusus di dalam area bobobox. kamar mandi dan wc tidak cukup banyak memang. tapi jika di momen yang tidak crowded seperti long weekend juga tidak terlalu masalah dengan hal ini. atau bisa diakali dengan mandi diawal waktu dan sejenisnya. mantab habis.

BANG bamBANG,4.0,"actually want to give a score of 5 because it is strategic, clean, safe and comfortable. -1 star because of parking extortion. let me tell you my experience: so before booking bobopod in the old city, I first researched from reviews on youtube and maps. so I know exactly where the location is, whether I can get there with google maps directions. after I arrived and was about to enter the parking lot, I was stopped by a man without a uniform, I was already turning right uphill to the building parking lot. a moment later I realized there was a cone covering the entrance to the building parking lot, I immediately concluded that the building parking lot was full and immediately took a parking lot outside, got out of the car and was immediately asked for a parking fee of 25 thousand rupiah, without a ticket. after that I went to the hotel to check this, it turned out that there was only 1 car parked in the building and several cars could still be parked. when checking in, the receptionist explained that parking in front of the building could not be until morning, and my car had to be moved to the parking lot in the building, and the parking ticket was brought to the receptionist to be stamped. long story short I checked out the next day. I gave the stamped parking ticket, then the parking attendant said ""oh, staying at bobobox, do you want to come back or check out sir?"" then wrote something in the parking guard post, then looked back at me and said ""20 thousand sir"". I could only grumble in my heart. I thought the parking ticket was stamped as a marker for free parking for bobobox guests, but it turned out they still had to pay. What I couldn't understand was when I protested to the parking security guard (Mr. Bald) after getting information from the receptionist earlier. Me: Sir, I want to enter the car- Bald: Where are you going?! Me: Bobobox Mr. Bald: Okay, just go in~ Me: Why did you stop me when I was about to enter? Bald: Who told you to? Me: It was in front earlier I wanted to enter- Bald: Who told you to?!! me: (wow the guest was yelled at) that one in front, there's a cone also blocking the entrance to the parking lot baldy: oh just tell him you want to go to bobobox, he'll find out later he'll open the way (while looking away) at that point I gave up talking to baldy and immediately moved the car. you know what? the parking attendant changed people. he thought I wanted to go out, so I said ""want to move parking to the inside of bobobox, the way is closed"" he replied ""probably the parking lot is full"" I immediately replied ""it's not full"". then he opened the cone blocking the way. so the conclusion is I stayed at bobobox in old city for one night, just for parking the car it cost 45 thousand rupiah. I suspect baldy got his share from extortion, or he just didn't have the courage to do the extortion.",a month,Bobopod Kota Tua Jakarta,"sebenarnya ingin kasih nilai 5 karena strategis, bersih, aman dan nyaman. -1 bintangnya karena pungli parkir.  saya ceritakan pengalaman saya : jadi saya sebelum booking bobopod di kota tua, saya riset dulu dari review di youtube dan maps. jadi tahu persis lokasinya di mana, apakah bisa ke sana dengan petunjuk google maps. setelah saya sampai dan hendak masuk ke parkiran, saya di setop oleh bapak2 tanpa seragam, saya posisi sudah belok kanan nanjak ke parkiran gedung. sesaat kemudian barulah saya tersadar ada cone yang menutupi pintu masuk parkir gedung, saya seketika menyimpulkan parkiran gedung sudah penuh dan langsung ambil parkiran di luar, keluar dari mobil biaya parkirnya langsung diminta 25 ribu rupiah, tanpa karcis. setelah itu saya menuju hotel untuk cek ini, ternyata yang parkir dalam gedung nya cuma ada 1 mobil dan masih bisa parkir beberapa mobil.  ketika check ini resepsionis menjelaskan bahwa parkir depan gedung tidak bisa sampai pagi, dan mobil saya harus dipindahkan ke parkiran dalam gedung, dan tiket parkirnya dibawa ke resepsionis untuk diberi stempel. singkat cerita saya check out keesokan harinya. saya memberikan tiket parkir yang sudah diberi stempel, kemudian penjaga parkirnya bilang ""oh, nginep di bobobox, mau balik lagi atau check out pak?"" kemudian menulis sesuatu di dalam pos jaga parkir, setelah itu kembali melihat saya dan bilang ""20 ribu pak"". saya cuma bisa menggerutu dalam hati. saya kira itu tiket parkir diberi stempel sebagai penanda parkir untuk tamu bobobox gratis, ternyata tetap bayar.  yang saya enggak habis pikir, ketika saya protes ke satpam (pak botak) parkiran setelah dapat info dari resepsionis tadi. saya : pak saya mau memasuki mob- botak : mau kemana?! saya : bobobox pak botak : yaudah memasuki saja~ saya : kok saya tadi mau masuk disetop ya? botak : disuruh siapa? saya : itu di depan tadi saya mau masuk kok- botak : disuruh siapa?!! saya : (buset tamu dibentak) itu yang di depan, ada cone nya juga menutupi jalan masuk parkiran botak : oh bilang saja mau ke bobobox entar juga dia tau dibukain jalannya sama dia (sambil membuang muka)  di situ saya menyerah mengomong sama sih botak dan langsung bertindak memindahkan mobil. tau enggak? yang jaga parkir ganti orang. dia kira saya mau keluar, yasudah saya bilang ""mau pindah parkir ke dalem di bobobox, itu jalannya ditutup"" dia jawab ""penuh kali parkirannya"" langsung saya jawab ""enggak penuh itu"". baru dibukain cone penutup jalannya sama dia.  jadi kesimpulannya saya nginep di bobobox kota tua semalam, untuk parkir mobil doang habis 45 ribu rupiah. saya curiga nya sih botak dapat jatah dari hasil pungli, atau memang enggak berani saja sama punglinya."

Fitria Wulan Sari,5.0,"came here during the fasting month, thank God I got food for sahur. the location is quite strategic because it is near the Jakarta Kota commuter line, but if you go home late at night, the old city is sterile. so the option is to ask permission from the security guard who guards the old city to pass because I'm staying at bobopod or go around (this is quite far, so it's not recommended). overall, for solo travelers, bobopod is always the best option.",2 months,Bobopod Kota Tua Jakarta,"kesini saat bulan puasa, alhamdulillah dapat makan buat sahur. lokasinya cukup strategis karena dekat krl jakarta kota, namun kalo pulang kemalaman kota tua sudah steril. jadi opsinya meminta izin satpam yang jaga ke kota tua buat lewat karena nginep di bobopod atau muter (ini cukup jauh, jadi enggak dianjurkan). overall, untuk solo traveler bobopod selalu jadi opsi terbaik."

dedtz,3.0,"Here's my experience staying for just 1 day (+) 1. The bathroom is clean & each hallway is kept sterile. 2. The location is right in the old city so it's quite strategic, if you want to walk around or look for food, there are lots of choices. 3. There are drink dispensers in every hallway (although my hallway's gallon ran out but it wasn't replaced), there is also a microwave in the communal room, and there are cutlery such as glasses/bowls/plates/spoons & forks. Now moving on to the minuses. (-) 1. Noisy. I stayed at Sky & the sound of people next door and in front entering/exiting the room or chatting could be heard by me. Also, the pods should be made soundproof, especially since this is in the old city where at night/evening there is live music in front that can really be heard & is very noisy. 2. There should be added rules & warnings about not being allowed (ngewski), because last night I really heard the pods next to/underneath, I don't know, like the sound of the mattress shaking & the sound of banging on the wall, this is the most hilarious thing. 3. Because this is in the old city, there is a time limit for leaving/entering the Kotu area, if it's after 9pm it's a hassle having to enter from the back (parking).  That's all, for this price, that's understandable & it's a great value if it's saving money, but hopefully it will be improved in the future, so that everyone is equally comfortable & the bobobox will be even better.",11 months,Bobopod Kota Tua Jakarta,"nih dari pengalaman saya nginep 1 hari saja ya  (+) 1. kamar mandi bersih & tiap lorong sterilisasinya terjaga. 2. lokasi persis di kota tua jadinya lumayan strategis, kalo mau jalan-jalan atau cari makan banyak banget pilihannya. 3. ada dispenser minum disetiap lorong (walaupun lorong saya galonnya habis tapi enggak diganti ganti), ada microwave juga di ruang komunalnya, sama tersedia alat makan kayak gelas/mangkuk/piring/sendok & garpu.  sekarang beralih ke minusnya. (-) 1. berisik. saya menginap di sky & suara orang sebelah dan depan masuk/keluar kamar ataupun mengobrol saja kedengaran sama saya. terus juga harusnya dibikin podsnya itu kedap suara, apalagi ini di kota tua yang kalo malam/sore ada live music didepan benar benar kedengaran & sangat berisik. 2. harusnya ditambahin peraturan & peringatin gaboleh (ngewski), karena kayaknya semalem saya benar benar kedengaran itu pods sebelah/bawah enggak tau kayak bunyi goyang goyang kasurnya & bunyi jedak jeduk kedindingnya, ini sih yang paling kocak banget. 3. karena ini di kota tua, jadi ada batas waktu keluar/masuk area kotu, kalo diatas jam 9 malam ribet harus masuk dari belakang (parkiran).  deh itu saja sih, kalo untuk harga segini ya maklum deh & great value kalo lagi ngirit, tapi semoga diperbaiki lagi seterusnya, biar semua juga sama-sama nyaman & bobobox jadi lebih baik lagi."

Item Lee,5.0,"arrived here around 8 pm. when I wanted to park I was a bit confused because the entrance to the parking lot was in front of many people selling, I don't know if there was an event or what, I don't understand because it was my first time staying in this area. and when I entered I also felt unsure because I was going through the stairs, my thoughts were all over the place, don't let the place be shabby, blah blah blah. eh when I entered, no, the place was clean and well-maintained, it turned out it was only along the stairs. when I arrived at the receptionist, I was asked to scan and measure my temperature, and was also explained how to enter the pods. just use the barcode from your cellphone and no key is needed. before entering the pods, guests are asked to take off their sandals and use the sandals that have been provided. and for those who don't want to go around taking a shower, please ask for a toothbrush and cup at the beginning. in the pods there are also tables and trash cans but eating is not allowed in the pods because a shared dining area has been provided. for men's and women's toilets are separated, and not far from the toilet there is also a prayer room. for those who usually sleep, the lights are dark, this can also be adjusted. As I recall, there is also a rule from 21.00-07.00 to maintain silence so as not to disturb other guests, because other guest rooms could be above or below our pods. because I was disturbed by the guest above me, it was almost dawn and it still sounded very noisy. in my opinion, this bobobox is suitable for backpackers. with the right room size, clean and comfortable. maybe gnats are difficult for those who are married, especially those with toddlers. for cleanliness, hopefully it will always be maintained so that customers always feel comfortable.",2 years,Bobopod Kota Tua Jakarta,"tiba di sini sekitar jam 8 malam. pas mau parkir agak bingung karena pintu masuk untuk keperkirannya di depan banyak orang jualan entah ada even atau apa enggak mengerti soalnya baru pertama nginep di daerah sini. dan pas masuk juga kayak enggak yakin ya karena lewat tangga pikiran sudah macam macam nih jangan sampai tempatnya lusuh blablabla. eh pas masuk enggak dong tempatnya bersih dan terawat ternyata cuma pas jalanan di tangganya saja. pas sampai di receptionist di meminta untuk scan dan ukur suhu, serta dijelaskan juga untuk masuk podsnya. cuma pakai barcode dari hp dan enggak usah pakai kunci. sebelum masuk ke pods tamu diminta untuk melepas sendal dan menggunakan sendal yang sudah di sediakan. dan bagi yang tidak ingin mondar mandi silakan meminta sikat gigi dan cup sekalian diawal. di pods ada meja juga dan tempat sampah tapi tidak diizinkan makan di pods karena sudah di sediakan tempat makan bersama. untuk toiletnya pria dan wanita di pisah ya, dan tidak jauh dari toilet ada mushola juga. untuk yang tidurnya biasanya lampunya gelap ini juga bisa di atur ya. seinget aku ada aturannya juga jam 21.00-07.00 diminta untuk menjaga ketenangan agar tidak mengganggu tamu yang lain, karena kamar tamu yang lain bisa saja ada di atas atau di bawah pods kita. karena saya sempat terganggu dengan tamu yang ada di atas saya, sudah hampir subuh masih terdengar sangat ramai. kalo menurutku ini bobobox ini cocok untuk backpacker. dengan ukuran kamar yang pas, bersih dan nyaman. mungkin agas susah bagi yang sudah berumah tangga apa lagi yang memiliki balita. untuk kebersihanya semoga tetap selalu di jaga agar pelanggan selalu merasa nyaman."

Raihaana Rizky,5.0,"First experience trying to stay at bobobox because I was curious about capsule hotels. Just in case, from the beginning I chose a double bed, but it turned out not to be as narrow as I imagined (although until now I have never tried a single one). The most amazing feature is the sound of the river and forest on the tablet pods. The nuance of sleeping at night really feels like being near a river or in the middle of a forest, adding to the impression when staying. The location is indeed a bit tucked away, so just ask people and they will definitely direct you. The main door closes according to the city's closing time, so if it's 9 o'clock, the only door that operates is the back door, which is close to a row of street vendors. But like most problems in tourist attractions, the price is more than usual and the taste is a bit less good. I personally prefer to eat egg crust because it costs 25k and the taste is guaranteed to be delicious. The bathroom is really okay, the shower works well. The toilet is also clean. What's nice is that from the moment you enter, everywhere smells good, so I'm happy. The public area is also complete because it provides hot water and a microwave. even on the second day I stayed, I was offered to change the sheets, blankets, and towels. but because I thought it was wasteful since I was the one using it, so I refused. the good thing is, because the location is in the old city area, so in the morning I can take pictures of the Fatahillah museum freely because it is still quiet. walking around the town square in the morning is also possible. so, overall my first experience staying at bobobox was really good and I want to come back again. thank you.",2 years,Bobopod Kota Tua Jakarta,"pengalaman pertama mencoba nginep di bobobox karena penasaran sama hotel kapsul. untuk jaga-jaga, sejak awal aku pilih kasur yang double bed, tapi ternyta enggak sesempit bayangan aku (walaupun sampai sekarang juga belum pernah mencoba yang single sih). fitur terdabesnya sih suara sungai dan hutan yang ada di tablet pods nya. nuansa tidur malam benaran berasa di dekat sungai atau di tengah hutan soalnya, menambah kesan saat menginap.  lokasinya memang agak nyelip, jadi tanya orang saja pasti akan di arahin. pintu utamanya tutup mengikuti jam tutupnya kotu, jadi kalau sudah jam 9 pintu yang beroperasi adalah pintu belakang, dimana dekat sama deretan pedagang kaki lima. tapi seperti kebanyakan masalah di tempat wisata, harganya lebih dari biasanya dan rasanya agak kurang oke. aku pribadi lebih pilih makan kerak telor saja karena harganya 25k dan rasanya terjamin enak.  untuk kamar mandi oke banget, shower berfungsi dengan baik. wc nya juga bersih. yang senang dari mulai masuk, dimana-mana itu wangi, jadi senang deh. public areanya juga lengkap karena nyediain air panas, dan microwave. bahkan di hari kedua aku nginep, aku ditawarin untuk digantiin sprei selimut, sama handuknya. tapi karena aku mikirnya boros toh yang memakai aku aku juga, jadi ku tolak.  enaknya lagi, karena lokasinya ada di dalam area kota tua, jadi pas pagi bisa foto museum fatahillah dengan leluasa karena masih sepi. keliling olahraga pagi di alun-alun juga bisa. so, overall pengalaman pertamaku nginep di bobobox oke banget sih dan pengin buat balik lagi. thank you."

I think it's standard leg 5. It's close to Indomaret and KFC.  overall recommended if there is no problem with the same door as there are 2 and different clocks. and the parking lot that is 1 is the same as the post office. because you can stop by the museum and have a snack downstairs in the evening.",2 years,Bobopod Kota Tua Jakarta,pintu hotel ada 2. untuk jam 07-17 lewat depan museum fatahilah. jam 17-07 lewat parkiran dalam kantor pos. keduanya ada dilantai 2.  biaya parkir 10k / malam. tinggal bilang kalo nginep di bobox. nanti dikasi pas mau keluar parkiran.  hotel standar bobobox. nyaman. bersih. kamar mandi juga sering dibersihin. ada mushola. ruang makan. free air galon.  kalo sore-malam banyak yang jual streetfood dibawah. lumayan banyak dan variatif. harga kisaran 10-15k. rasa ya standar kaki 5. dekat dengan indomaret sama kfc.  overall rekomen kalo enggak masalah sama pintu yang ada 2 dan beda jam. dan parkiran yang jadi 1 sama kantor pos. karena bisa mampir ke museum dan jajan dibawah kalo malem2.

Hireka Eric Surianto,1.0,"bobobox old city offers knick-knacks that look sophisticated, but are not essential. The essentials are not there. 1. Difficult access. Guests want to check in at night as soon as possible, and do not have to deal with the old city security, call the front desk, wait for hotel security. Access is closed from 10 pm making this hostel like an old-fashioned boarding house. 2. The handover of keys must go through a complicated process: download the app, register, 4-digit code, photo and upload your own ID card. People don't need all that to enter any hotel room in the world. 3. To enter and exit the room, guests must bring a cellphone, including to the bathroom. It is still more practical to use a tap card. 4. This hostel is too stingy to the point of not providing drinking water. No guest anywhere in the world expects their room to have colorful lights that can be controlled from the application. What they expect is drinking water and towels. 5. The exit provided through the back door (to find drinking water) is decorated with trash bags, muddy, unkempt stairs, and rats running around on the ground floor.

Ananda Putri,5.0,"previously never thought to staycation at bobobox.. only know, the concept is minimalist bed. finally confused looking for a place to stretch out to wait for the train departure time in the middle of the night, while at that time it was still 3 pm.. because lazy to walk around plus carrying a suitcase and not feeling well, thought to book here just to lie down. turned out the place is very comfortable. clean. and not as crowded as I imagined. enough space to lie down rolling right and left 😀. and the place smells very good. indeed when entering, it was a bit of an effort to carry a suitcase up the stairs, because the position of bobobox is on the 2nd floor, on Malioboro street right above the souvenir building. but, the check-in process is very easy and the officer is friendly explaining to me who has never tried bobobox anywhere. so, to check in this must use the bobobox application, and for the room key also use the application. not allowed to bring shoes into the room. shoes are stored in the locker & exchanged for sandals. also not allowed to eat in the room, there is a dining place provided on the 3rd floor. here also sold ready-to-eat food & we just warm it ourselves in the microwave on the 3rd floor. there is also a prayer room on the 3rd floor, quite spacious & clean. for the toilet & bathroom is shared, but very clean. comfortable.. hair dryer also lent. oh yeah, when sleeping there is also a feature to adjust the lights & sound to relax while sleeping. I tried all the light features hahaha..😅😅 and there is a no noise clock at 21.00 to 07.00. this is effective for me who fell asleep for a few hours here.",2 months,Bobopod Malioboro Yogyakarta,"sebelumnya enggak pernah terfikir untuk staycation di bobobox.. cuman tau, konsepnya itu tempat tidur minimalis.  sampailah bingung cari tempat selonjoran untuk menunggu jam keberangkatan kereta api di tengah malam, sedangkan saat itu masih jam 15.00.. karena malas jalan-jalan plus nenteng koper dan lagi enggak enak badan juga, kepikiranlah untuk booking disini untuk sekadar rebahan.  ternyata tempatnya nyaman banget. bersih. dan enggak se-sesak yang ku bayangkan. cukup leluasa untuk tiduran guling-guling kanan kiri😀. dan wangi sekali tempatnya.  memang pas masuk, agak effort nenteng koper naik tangga, karena posisi boboboxnya di lantai 2, di jalan malioboro tepat diatas bangunan tempat oleh-oleh.  tapi, proses check innya sangat mudah dan petugasnya ramah menjelaskan ke aku yang belum pernah mencoba bobobox dimanapun. jadi, untuk check ini harus pakai aplikasi bobobox, dan untuk kunci kamar juga pakai aplikasi.  tidak diperkenankan membawa sepatu ke kamar. sepatu disimpan di loker & ditukar dengan sandal.  tidak diperkenankan juga makan di kamar, ada tempat makan disediakan di lantai 3. disini juga dijual makanan siap saji & kita tinggal hangatkan sendiri di microwave di lantai 3.  ada mushola juga di lantai 3, cukup luas & bersih.  untuk toilet & tempat mandi ini sharing, tapi bersih banget. nyaman.. dipinjamkan juga hair dryernya.  oia, pas tidur juga ada fitur pengaturan lampu & suara untuk relax saat tidur. semua fitur lampu kucoba hahaha..😅😅 dan ada jam tidak boleh berisik di jam 21.00 sd 07.00. ini ampuh sih buatku yang tertidur beberapa jam disini."

sukron aja,4.0,"Honestly, the service is very good, friendly and set.  for the don't ask again location, it's very strategic in the middle of the Malioboro area, so if you want to go for a walk, just go downstairs until you reach it. 👍 for the pods room yesterday we took the dooble earth room, wort it is quite spacious, there is an AC that can be adjusted to the level of coldness in the lobby area, there are also various kinds of snacks/food/drinks that can be bought, for the price I don't know yet because at that time had not tried to buy.  for those of you who are hungry, don't worry because there are also many culinary places around the accommodation that you can try, for example: in the morning, you can go to Jalan Dagen there is porridge, gudeg, there is soup, there are market snacks during the day and night, you can try the soup on the left side of Bobobox it's pretty good, soto minus: *if you want to stay here, it's not recommended because to enter the lobby you have to go up the stairs first, and to go to the bathroom you also have to go up the stairs first, we happened to get podroom no. 2* an. but for other than bumil, so this accommodation is highly recommended.",10 months,Bobopod Malioboro Yogyakarta,"jujurly untuk pelayanan nya oke banget, ramah dan sat set.  untuk lokasi don't ask again strategis banget ada di tengah-tengah kawasan malioboro, so kalo mau jalan-jalan tinggal turun kebawah sampai deh. 👍  untuk pods room nya kemarin kita ambil yang dooble earth room, wort it lah lumayan luas, ada ac nya yang bisa diatur tingkat kedinginan nya  di area lobby juga di sediakan berbagai macam snack/makanan/minuman yang bisa dibeli, untuk harga saya belum tahu karena waktu itu belum mencoba beli.  untuk kalian yang kelaperan jangan khawatir karena sekitar penginapan banyak juga kuliner yang bisa kalian coba contohnya: kalo pagi, kalian bisa ke jalan dagen ada bubur, gudeg, ada soto, ada jajanan pasar kalo siang-malam, kalian bisa coba soto yang disamping kiri bobobox lumayan enak itu soto  minus nya: *kalo untuk bumil yang ingin menginap disini enggak recomended karena untuk masuk ke lobby kita harus naik tangga dulu, dan untuk ke kamar mandi juga sama naik tangga dulu kebetulan kita dapat podroom no 2* an. but untuk selain bumil so recomended banget nih penginapan."

Jenivia R,5.0,"very satisfied staying at bobobox pods malioboro. besides its very strategic location, the service is also very good (the staff are very helpful). considering that I stayed for quite a long time, the receptionist took the initiative to clean my room (I also got a new towel because of it) and when I just arrived also offered to help carry my suitcase to my room on the 3rd floor. bobobox pods malioboro is also routinely cleaned, the air conditioner is cold, security is good, the atmosphere is calm, not noisy, and the bathroom is clean. some suggestions for improvement from me are the door to the women's bathroom on the 3rd floor likes to make a creaking sound so it might be a bit disturbing especially for pods that are in front of the bathroom, when I just arrived my bed sheet was also a bit dirty and found some stains but this is certainly not a big problem because bobobox is willing to replace it.",11 months,Bobopod Malioboro Yogyakarta,"sangat puas menginap di bobobox pods malioboro. selain lokasinya yang sangat strategis, pelayanan juga sangat baik (para staf sangat helpful). mengingat saya menginap cukup lama, resepsionis inisiatif menawarkan untuk membersihkan ruangan saya (saya juga mendapat handuk baru karenanya) dan saat saya baru tiba juga menawarkan bantuan untuk membawa koper ke ruang saya yang ada di lantai 3. bobobox pods malioboro juga rutin dibersihkan, ac dingin, kemanan bagus, atmosfernya tenang, tidak berisik, dan kamar mandinya bersih. beberapa saran perbaikan dari saya adalah pintu kamar mandi perempuan lantai 3 suka bunyi berderit sehingga mungkin agak mengganggu khususnya bagi pods yang ada di depan kamar mandi pas, saat baru tiba sprei saya juga agak kotor dan menemukan beberapa noda namun ini tentu bukan masalah besar karena bobobox bersedia untuk mengganti."

Om Abdul (Abede),2.0,"This is a real assessment according to what I feel myself, one of the receptionists has a very sour face. modern but still troublesome. the bathroom is rarely cleaned even though there is a check table. for management it seems they should add special bathroom personnel. the lobby is dirty. the mattress and bed sheets are dirty with lots of unclear stains, be more selective in placing personnel at the reception. thank you, hopefully in the future the service and quality can be better.",a year,Bobopod Malioboro Yogyakarta,"ini penilaian real sesuai yang saya rasakan sendiri, salah satu resepsionis asem banget mukanya. modern tapi masih menyusahkan. kamar mandi yang jarang dibersihkan walaupun disana ada tabel pengecekan. untuk managemen sepertinya harus  tambah personil khusus kamar mandi. loby kotor. kasur dan sperei dekil banyak bercak enggak jelas lebih selektif untuk menempatkan personil di resepsionis. terima kasih mudah mudahan kedepan bisa lebih baik pelayanan dan kwalitasnya."

Lany Indra,5.0,"100 for the super friendly staff. 90 for the room because the mattress is thin, not high like bobobox in Bandung. For the bathroom, I'm sorry I give it 50 because it's dirty, slippery, smelly, and lots of other trash (hair and tissue) and the showers are broken, there are 2 or 3 that haven't been fixed even though there must be lots of people staying there during New Year's. Imagine out of so many people and only 2 showers that can be used for bathing 👎🏼 there must be a long queue 🚫 and one more suggestion from me, it's better to buy your own sandals, don't use hotel sandals because they're slippery and I've almost slipped in the bathroom twice. Or just a suggestion for bobobox to replace the sandals with regular flip-flops, don't wear cloth sandals because I'm afraid someone will slip, it's very dangerous 🙇🏻‍♀️",a year,Bobopod Malioboro Yogyakarta,"nilai 100 buat staff-nya yang super ramah banget. nilai 90 untuk kamar-nya karena kasurnya tipis enggak yang tinggi  seperti bobobox yang di bandung. kalo untuk kamar mandi mohon maaf saya kasih nilai 50 karena kotor, licin, bau, dan banyak sampah lainnya (rambut dan tissue) dan shower yang rusak ada 2 atau 3 enggak kunjung dibenerin padahal moment tahun baru pasti banyak yang menginap. bayangkan dari sekian banyak manusia dan shower yang bisa dipakai buat mandi cuman 2 👎🏼 sudah pasti antri banget 🚫 dan satu lagi saran dari saya mending beli sendal sendiri saja jangan pakai sendal hotel karena licin dan saya sudah 2x hampir kepleset di kamar mandi. atau saran saja buat bobobox untuk sendalnya diganti dengan sendal jepit biasa jangan sendal kain karena takut nanti amit-amit ada yang kepleset bahaya banget 🙇🏻‍♀️"

ariniOwL Galih,5.0,"it's just that there is no lift to go to the lobby, it's enough to carry a suitcase, you have to go up the steep stairs too 😅 it just so happened that the name of the box has earth which means lower box and sky for floor or upper box.  I happened to choose the sky box and the original one is very high for the cave which is 153. for the stairs to go up the box is very small, yes it's a bit scary, it's good for the cave but for the facilities it's really ok.  There are plenty of clean toilets available, don't bring towels and toothbrushes here to prepare.  musola is also available, a nongrong place for those of you who like whipping is also provided, a water gallon place is also available, all you have to do is bring a tumbler.  the best thing is the internet is super duper fast and stable bro. and this is in the middle of the city so it's perfect if you want to eat in the afternoon or evening, you can walk a little bit, there's a lot of angringan and starbuck's next to it guys, that's all my sweet comments, I hope I can help you guys 😊",a year,Bobopod Malioboro Yogyakarta,"cuma kurang lift untuk ke loby saja lumayan buat bawa koper harus naik ketangga pegel juga wa😅  kebetulan nama boxnya ada earth artinya box bawah dan sky untuk box tingkat atau atas.  kebetulan gua pilih box sky dan asli tinggi banget buat gua yang tingginya 153. untuk tangga naik keatas boxnya terbilang kecil banget, ya rada ngeri-ngeri sedep bagi gua tapi untuk fasilitas ok banget.  tersedia wc yang bersih dan banyak, enggak bawa handuk dan sikat gigi di sini menyiapkan.  musola juga ada, tempat nongrong buat kalian yang hobi sebat juga disediakan, tempat galon air juga ada tinggal kalian bawa tumbler saja.  yang pali the best adalah internetnya yang super duper kencang mantap gan.dan ini tuh ada di tengah-tengah kota jadi pas banget kalau sore ke malam mau cari makan bisa lah jalan sedikit banyak angringan dan sebelahnya starbuck guys  sekian ulasan manis saya semoga bisa membantu kalian 😊"

The bathroom is quite clean, even though when I got there there were some that I couldn't use. rooftop is quite comfortable. there is a sink to wash your utensils and a mosque next to it. next time, if you stay here and do not feel comfortable with the narrow room, it is better to take a bigger room and not the pod above. because it's quite rough when packing^^;;",a year,Bobopod Malioboro Yogyakarta,"lokasi agak nyempil di antara deretan gedung tapi strategis kok karena disamping starbucks malioboro. lumayan kalau misal jalan kaki ke stasiun. becak/ojol ya tanggung. pelayanan oke. kamar mandi cukup bersih, biarpun pas saya kesana ada beberapa yang enggak bisa dipakai. rooftop cukup nyaman. ada sink buat cuci alat makan kalian dan mushola di sebelahnya. next time, kalau nginep disini dan buat yang enggak nyaman dengan ruangan sempit, sebaiknya ambil kamar yang lebih besar dan jangan pod yang di atas. karena lumayan grasak-grusuk waktu packing^^;;"

This model is also suitable for those who like ""silence"", or just sleeping. because there are no facilities such as television unless you use your own gadgets, or swimming pools and other entertainment. Also, your feet are healthy because if you get to the pods at the corner or at the top, there is no elevator yet, but walk in the hallway and stairs. the disadvantage is that there is no parking lot, so search first for motorcycle or car parking. prl more fragrances in kmr mndi. The frontofficer is friendly, but when changing shifts, someone's tone is too strict, so the impression is that they are aggressive at first, even though they haven't even spoken yet. the problem is that I have been to other bobobox, everyone is friendly even though they change shifts hehe.. please pay attention. which is a pity, some users, who may not yet understand or have no awareness of what it means to use together & about this type of hotel. like in the bathroom, close the sink faucet or toilet after use, flush clean, clean the trash. also in the pantry and rooftop where you can only eat there and this is a good rule as it is. pls throw away the trash, there is also a lot of trash. and if you use shared utilities such as the plates and spoons that have been kindly prepared, wash them and return them to their place. because this item is used together, so that others can also use it. and throw away the trash if the filter is full of dirt after you wash it. don't just leave all those things alone. this is not a resto n this is shared public areas and facilities :(( this is what sometimes makes a hotel good/comfortable or not, it depends on the occupants as well. so the final suggestion, find accommodation that suits your type. and pls let's take care of the comfort of the hotel together, fine traditional or modern hotel like this. keep going bobobox, love you..",2 years,Bobopod Malioboro Yogyakarta,"lokasi strategis banget pas di emper malioboro tengah-tengah & bagi saya bersih :di cocok buat yang familiar dengan gadgeting only ya, karena di sini sebagian operasi fasilitas dan urusan admin serba digital. so selalu bawa hp kemana2 dan jaga baterai aman. model ini juga cocok buat yang suka ""keheningan"", atau prl tidur2 doang. karena enggak ada fasilitas seperti tivi kecuali pakai gadget sendiri, atau kolan renang dan hiburan lain. juga prl sehat kaki karena kalo kebagian pods agak pojok atau atas, belum ada lift, tapi jalan di lorong dan tangga. kekurangan enggak ada lahan parkir jadi search dulu ya penitipan parkir motor atau mobil. prl lebih banyak pengharum di kmr mndi. frontofficernya ramah sih, tapi waktu ganti shift ada yang nadanya terlalu tegas jadi kesannya galak duluan, padahal mengomong pun belum. soalnya pernah ke bobobox lain semua ramah meski shift ganti hehe.. mohon diperhatikan. yang disayangkan, sebagian pengguna sih, yang mungkin belum paham atau belum ada awareness/kesadaran apa arti pakai bersama & tentang hotel jenis begini. seperti kmr mandi ya ditutup baik dong kran wastafel atau wc setelah pakai, siram bersih, sampah diberesin. juga di pantri dan rooftop dimana hanya boleh makan di situ dan ini aturan bagus sbnrnya. dibuang pls sampahnya, kan juga ada bak sampah buanyak. dan kalo pakai shared utilities kayak piring sendok yang sudah baik hati disediain, cuci dan kembalikan tempatnya. karena ini barang pakai bersama, supaya yang lain juga bisa pakai. dan buang sampah jika saringannya penuh kotoran habis kamu mencuci. jangan ditinggal begitu saja semua hal itu. nih bukan resto n ini shared public areas and facilities :(( inilah yang kadang membuat hotel bagus/nyaman jadi enggak, tergantung penghuninya juga. jadi saran akhir, carilah penginapan sesuai tipe kamu saja deh. dan pls yuk jaga kenyamanan hotel itu bersama, baik hotel tradisionil atau modern macam begini. maju terus bobobox, love lu.."

Yogi NW,5.0,"The first experience staying here was very positive. At first I was a bit pessimistic about the accommodation which started with steep stairs going up, clearly the target market for this accommodation is not luxury traveler suitcases. Up there, I was greeted by a super friendly and informative plus patient receptionist, I will explain her patience. Bobobox has a futuristic minimalist yet luxurious accommodation concept. This concept is still foreign to me, even those who are not considered technologically illiterate. Here the receptionist explained very patiently and in detail. When all personal data is complete, to enter the room we are required to change into Bobobox sandals to avoid dirty and ""fragrant"" shoes entering the room area. The entrance to the room is only big enough for one person, but it turns out to be very spacious inside. Unbelievable. The room system is two pods stacked top and bottom. The room is very compact, enough for two people in the room I occupied. There is a small table and space to put bags. Eating in the room is not allowed, drinking is allowed. Only clean towels are provided without other toiletries. While in the room, it is not allowed to make noise during quiet hours, as far as I remember between 9pm-5am. other facilities provided are clean water dispensers provided outside the room in several spots in the room, a dining room in front of the reception considering that eating in the room is not allowed, and a shared bathroom with a room shape like a shower room, bathroom, swimming pool and free shampoo & soap provided in the shower. my experience staying there was very pleasant, a compact room to rest and the mattress was very comfortable for my standards who like kapok mattresses, the air conditioner was just right, not hot and not super cold, there were blankets too. then it was also not noisy, all those staying obeyed quiet hours. and most importantly, the room was very clean, starting from the floor, walls, air conditioner, bathroom, dining room etc. if there was time and opportunity, I would stay here again.",2 years,Bobopod Malioboro Yogyakarta,"pengalaman pertama menginap disini sangat positif.  pertama datang agak pesimis tentang penginapan yang dimulai dengan tangga naik curam ke atas, jelas target pasar penginapan ini bukan koper mewah traveller.  sampai di atas, saya disambut oleh resepsionis yang super ramah dan informatif plus sabar, saya akan jelaskan sabarnya.  bobobox memiliki konsep penginapan futuristik yang minimalis namun mewah fitur. konsep ini masih asing untuk saya bahkan yang tidak terbilang gaptek. disini resepsionis menjelaskan dengan sangat sabar dan detail.  ketika semua terkait data diri beres, untuk masuk kamar kita diwajibkan berganti sendal bobobox untuk menghindari kotor dan ""wangi"" sepatu  masuk area kamar.  pintu masuk ruang kamar hanya cukup untuk satu orang, namun ternyata sangat amat luas di dalamnya. tidak bisa dipercaya.  sistem kamarnya adalah dua pod bertumpuk atas bawah. rhangannya sangat compact, cukup untuk dua orang di ruangan yang saya tempati. ada meja kecil dan space untuk meletakkan tas. tidak diperbolehkan untuk makan di ruangan, minum diperbolehkan. hanya handuk bersih disediakan tanpa perlengkapan mandi lainnya.  selama di ruang kamar tidak diperbolehkan untuk membuat bising di jam quiet hours, seinget saya antara jam 9malam-5pagi.  fasilitas lainnya yang disediakan adalah dispenser air bersih disediakan diluar kamar di beberapa spot ruang kamar, ruang makan di depan resepsionis mengingat tidak diperbolehkan untuk makan di kamar, dan kamar mandi bersama dengan bentuk ruangan seperti ruang bilas kamar mandi kolam renang dan disediakan shampo&sabun gratis di shower.  pengalaman saya menginap sangat menyenangkan, ruang yang compact untuk istirahat dan kasurnya sangat nyaman untuk standar saya yang suka kasur kapuk, ac dinginnya pas, tidak panas dan tidak super dingin, terdapat selimut juga. kemudian juga tidak bising, semua yang menginap menaati quiet hours. dan yang paling penting, ruang kamar sangat bersih, mulai dari lantai, dinding, ac, kamar mandi, ruang makan dll  apabila ada waktu dan kesempatan,  saya akan menginap disini lagi."

Anisya Hanum,1.0,"change the laundry person! I took my friend to check this because I happened to book the hotel using my cellphone, when I wanted to go down it turned out the elevator was out of order for almost 1 hour, I was stuck and couldn't go down because the laundry person took down the goods and didn't coordinate with the upper part, finally the elevator was out of order and no one could go up or down! the emergency stairs were very far and dark because they were in a mall. can you imagine what would happen if something happened at bobobox mega bekasi? when I forced myself down using the emergency stairs and I wanted to go to the laundry person but he had run away and was irresponsible! only 1 receptionist and 1 technician helped me. the other receptionist didn't help me at all. in a trapped situation at 11 pm, there was someone in the elevator who called out to press the emergency button, finally because I was the one near the elevator I tried to answer the phone, when I was trying to explain what happened above with my situation as a visitor and the one who was trapped was also a guest who was staying, suddenly the emergency call was turned off by the receptionist. instead of him taking over to calm the one below, he turned it off. how is the service? for management I don't want to mention the characteristics but it must be visible on CCTV who is busy helping me and other guests who are staying and who is calm and does not take any action. at least for those with bad service, they are given a lesson on how to serve! learn from 2 employees (receptionist and technician) of bobobox who really make an effort to help solve the problem, yes, the men who were receptionists on the night of Thursday, March 2, 2023. please follow up. if this review disappears or bobobox denies it, I have a video!",a year,Bobopod Mega Mall Bekasi,"ganti orang laundrynya !  saya mengantar teman saya untuk check ini karena kebetulan memesan hotelnya menggunakan hp saya, pada saat saya mau turun ternyata lift error hampir 1 jam kejebak enggak bisa turun karena orang laundry turunin barang dan tidak koordinasi dengan bagian atas, akhirnya lift error dan enggak ada yang bisa naik atau turun! tangga darurat jauh sekali dan gelap karena masuk mall. terbayang enggak kalo ada apa-apa di bobobox mega bekasi bagaimana? pas saya memaksakan turun dengan tangga darurat dan saya mau samper orang laundrynya tapi dia sudah kabur dan tidak bertanggung jawab!  yang bantu cuman 1 resepsionis dan 1 teknisi. resepsionis yang 1 lagi enggak ada bantunya sama sekali. dalam keadaan kejebak jam 11 malam lewat, ada orang di dalem lift yang manggil-manggil pencet tombol darurat akhirnya karena saya yang dekat lift saya mencoba angkat telfonnya, pas saya lagi coba jelasin apa yang terjadi diatas dengan keadaan saya sebagai pengunjung dan yang kejebak juga tamu yang sedang menginap, tiba-tiba panggilan darurat itu di matikan sama resepsionis itu. bukannya dia yang ambil alih buat nenangin yang dibawah eh malah di matiin. bagaimana sih servicenya? untuk management saya enggak mau sebutin ciri-cirinya tapi pasti kelihatan di cctv siapa yang sibuk bantuin saya dan tamu lain yang nginep dan siapa yang tenang-tenang saja dan enggak ada aksi apapun. at least untuk yang bad service diberikan pelajaran bagaimana cara service! belajar dengan 2 karyawan (resepsionis dan teknisi) bobobox yang benar-benar effort buat bantu nyelesaiin masalah ya mas mas yang jadi resepsionis pada malam hari kamis, 2 maret 2023.  tolong tindak lanjuti. apabila review ini hilang atau bobobox mengelak saya ada videonya!"

Zaki Jaki,4.0,"plus winning in location because it is in Pancoran South Jakarta, where easy access to everywhere can be, for the room, as usual bobo box is generally a capsule hotel but comfortable, advice if you are big and want to be free, don't look for a room upstairs, it's quite good for relieving fatigue and transit, cheap price around 180 thousand, cold air conditioning, sleeping like in an Alphard car, there is ambience light lol can listen to songs too if you sleep for music lovers and like to be upset, minus can't pay in cash if there is a problem with the ATM, either wrong PIN blocked or whatever, be prepared lol, so non-cash payments, ATMs around the location are quite far past 6 buildings and the ATM is inside the building so if there is an emergency, especially at night or even early morning, be prepared, in front of the location there is a shop but it doesn't open until morning, aka hungry in the early hours of the morning it's a hassle not to be able to find it directly at the location, buying drinks can't be done in cash, if you like to bring cash it's useless, the mosque for Friday prayers is available, it can be next to the TNI complex. the friendliness of the employees is still lacking in terms of service. car parking is available. a serious minus toilet or bathroom queue can only be one even though it is provided but at that time only one was available.",a year,Bobopod Pancoran Jakarta,"plus menang dilokasi karena berada di pancoran jaksel, dimana akses mudah lah kemana mana bisa, untuk kamar ya seperti biasa bobo box pada umumnya hotel kapsul tapi nayaman saran jika badan besar dan pengin bebas jangan cari kamar atas bawah saja, lumayan buat melepas penat dan transit harga murah 180rb an, ac dingin, tidur seperti dalam mobil alphard ada ambience lightnya wkwkwk bisa mendengarkan lagu juga kalo pas tidur bagi penikmat musik dan suka galau, minus tidak bisa bayar dengan tunai jika ada masalah dengan atm entah salah pin terblokir atau apalah siap siap saja wkwk, jadi pembayaran non tunai, atm sekitar lokasi lumayan jauh melewati 6 gedung dan atmnya di dalam gedung jadi jika kondisi darurat apalagi malam bahkan dini hari siap siap saja, depan lokasi ada warung cuman tidak buka sampai pagi alias kelaperan pada dini hari repot tidak bisa cari dilokasi langsung, beli minuman juga tidak bisa tunai non tunai, jika yang hobby bawa duit cash sia sia, masjid untuk sholat pada hari jumat tersedia bisa kesebelah komplek tni. keramahan pegawai masih kurang dalam hal pelayanan. parkiran mobil tersedia. minus parah toilet atau kamar mandi antri hanya bisa satu padahal deh disediakan tapi yang bisa pada waktu itu satu."

It turned out that I couldn't. The staff was friendly enough but didn't provide a solution so I went back to Gambir and showered in Gambir.

rahma saja,4.0,"good, strategic location, easy process. and very well maintained cleanliness. the location is also strategic, close to Indomaret. so if you want to buy snacks, just walk to the gas station next door. unfortunately to enter you need to go around the side because there is a large ditch in front. in the lobby there are some snacks and drinks for visitors to buy. there are also lockers to store items. when checking in, you are required to use the application. after checking in, there will be a bar code in the application that functions as a room access key. after checking in, you should immediately take the toothbrush provided at the reception desk. and sandals in the locker (not put in the proposal) each floor is provided with a dispenser near the door. so for guests who come can refill their drinks for free. the cleanliness of the general facilities is very good. here there is a prayer room, cafe, and shared bathroom. the room is comfortable, not as small as I imagined. there is a button to adjust the brightness of the room light. and also set a calming ambience sound. but for me, the weakness is that the temperature in the bedroom is too cold (or can it actually be adjusted personally?)",a year,Bobopod Pancoran Jakarta,"bagus,tempatnya strategis,prosesnya gampang.dan kebersihannya sangat terjaga.  lokasinya juga strategis,dekat dengan indomaret.jadi kalo mau jajan tinggal jalan ke pom bensin seblah.sayangnya untuk masuk perlu agak muter disampingnya karena depannya ada parit besar.  dilobi disediakan beberapa cemilan dan minuman untuk pengunjung beli.terdapat juga loker untuk menyimpan barang.  saat check ini diharuskan menggunakan aplikasi.setelah check ini, diaplikasi ini akan ada bar code yang berfungsi sebagai kunci akses kamar. sesudah checkin,sebaiknya langsung ambil sikat gigi yang disediakan dimeja resepsionis.dan sendal di loker (bukan ditaro dalem lamar ya)  setiap lantai disediakan dispenser dekat pintu.jadi buat tamu yang datang bisa refill minumnya gratis.  kebersihan fasilitas umumnya baik sekali.disini terdapat musholah,cafe,dan kamar mandi bersama.  kamarnya nyaman,tidak sekecil yang saya bayangkan.ada tombol untuk pengaturan terang gelapnya cahaya kamar. dan juga menyetel suara ambience yang calming.  namun buat saya,kelemahannya adalah suhu dalam ruang tidurnya terlalu dingin (atau sebenarnya bisa di adjust pribadi?)"

Agoes Santosa,5.0,"- I checked this for a sky single room at 22.30, the host explained it kindly and completely to me as a first-timer staying at bobobox (how to open the door, not allowed to bring food, etc.). - The lobby area is clean and bright, to enter the building you have to turn a little to the complex door because there is a river in front of it. - The room is not as small as I thought. There is still space to sit (the ceiling is not that low). The mood lamp color can be adjusted via the application, as well as the brightness of the lights. We can also turn on river or forest music to help us sleep. - The pillows and mattress are actually ordinary but quite good and clean for the price paid (210 thousand per night). The AC cannot be adjusted for temperature. For me it's just right but for people who are fussy with AC it might feel lacking. - The communal area (for eating, because there is a microwave there) is quite large, there is a prayer room on the 3rd floor. The canteen (all ready-to-eat food or snacks) is on the ground floor. - The bathroom is also communal. Cleaner than expected and quite comfortable to take a shower there. p.s.: I have never ordered from bobobox before so I only read reviews on the internet. Just like the reviews, it is recommended to install the bobobox app first because it is used to open the door and check this.",2 years,Bobopod Pancoran Jakarta,"- saya check ini untuk kamar sky single di jam 22.30, host menjelaskan dengan ramah dan lengkap saya sebagai orang yang pertama kali menginap di bobobox (cara buka pintu, tidak boleh bawa makanan, dll). - area lobby bersih dan terang, untuk masuk ke dalam gedung harus sedikit memutar ke pintu kompleks karena ada kali di depannya. - kamarnya tidak sekecil yang saya duga. masih ada ruang untuk duduk (langit-langit tidak serendah itu). mood lamp warnanya bisa diatur lewat aplikasi, begitu juga tingkat keterangan lampu bisa diatur. kita bisa nyalakan juga musik sungai atau hutan untuk membantu tidur. - bantal dan kasur sebenarnya biasa saja tapi tergolong bagus dan bersih untuk harga yang dibayar (210rb semalam). ac-nya enggak bisa diatur suhunya. buat saya sih pas ya tapi buat orang yang rewel dengan ac mungkin akan merasa kurang. - area komunal (untuk makan, karena ada microwave di situ) lumayan besar, ada musholla di lantai 3. kantin (semuanya makanan siap saji atau cemilan) ada di lantai dasar. - kamar mandinya komunal juga. lebih bersih dari dugaan dan cukup nyaman mandi di situ.  p.s.: sebelumnya saya belum pernah pesan di bobobox jadi hanya baca review di internet saja. sama seperti ulasan yang ada, direkomendasikan untuk install app bobobox dulu karena dipakai untuk buka pintu dan check ini."

Raihaana Rizky,4.0,"In terms of location, it is quite strategic, close to the center of Jakarta, and close to Tebet, the center of Jakarta's trendy snacks. But because the location is in a shophouse, there is a parking fee, 50 per day, so I who stayed for 3 days and 2 nights had to pay 15.0. In terms of the room layout, I was confused because it turned out that the prayer room and public area were only on the 3rd floor. Mobility between floors is good because there is an elevator. The rooms are the same as every bobobox. The only thing lacking is the bathroom, the shower water is not clear how hot or cold it is, I have turned it to the right but hot water still comes out, so I'm confused about what to do. If there is a problem with the water flow, it's still normal, right? And the spray in the toilet is also lacking, some of the water is a bit slanted, etc. The service is what I really like, the receptionist is friendly. Overall everything is okay, my experience is still fun. And I don't regret staying there again. It's just that sometimes it gets noisy from neighboring rooms because it's only limited by thick plywood.",2 years,Bobopod Pancoran Jakarta,"secara tempat cukup strategis, ke tengah jakarta dekat, ke tebet yang pusat jajanan hits jakarta juga dekat. tapi karena lokasinya ada di ruko, jadi ada biaya parkirnya, sehari 50, jadi aku yang nginep 3 hari 2 malam perlu bayar 15.0.  secara layout kamarnya, aku sempat kebingungan karena ternyata musholla dan public area adanya hanya di lantai 3 saja. mobilisasi antar lantainya sih enak karena ada liftnya. untuk kamar sama saja setiap bobobox.  hanya saja yang kurang di bagian kamar mandinya sih, air showernya enggak jelas begitu panas dinginnya, sudah arahin ke kanan masih saja air panas yang keluar, jadi bingung musti bagaimana. kalo masalah aliran air yang tina tiba kencang terus biasa saja begitu sih masih normallah ya. dan semprotan di wc nya juga ada yang nyemprotnya kurang, ada yang agak miring airnya, dll. servicenya sih yang aku suka banget, mas resepsionisnya ramah.  overall semua oke, pengalamanku juga tetap asik. dan enggak kapok nginep disitu lagi. cuman kadang keberisikan sama tetangga kamar saja karena cuma dibatasin triplek tebal."

The check-in is a bit complicated because you have to take a photo of the ktp and take a selfie with the ktp as if you want to show off haha. free mineral water by request because a dispenser has been prepared outside the pod. free vitamin becomzet is also quite good for 3 thousand. Yes, there is a coffee machine too, but you have to pay. Whether it's ready meals, pop noodles, snacks, etc. like Bobobox in other places. The room is clean, there are already 2 towels and there is soap and shampoo in the bathroom. only no toothbrush. the bathroom also smells very bad, not clean as well. the place of prayer is the same as the dining room on the 3rd floor, it's horrible because the windows don't have curtains and the roof has holes. Please fix it again",2 years,Bobopod Pancoran Jakarta,"pertama kali coba bobobox yang di pancoran biasanya yang di kebayoran. untuk akses ke tempatnya ngelewatin palang yang di jaga untuk parkir kalo malam, tapi kalo pagi enggak ada yang juga parkir. jadi kalo malam naik ojol turun di palang jalan kaki bentar. akses dekat jalan dan indomaret. pas check ini memang sedikit ribet karena harus photo ktp dan selfie with ktp kayak mau pinjol haha. free air mineral by request karena sudah disediain dispenser di luar pod. free vitamin becomzet juga lumayan 1nya 3ribuan. oiya ada mesin kopi juga tapi bayar ya. sama ada makanan siap saji, pop mie, cemilan dll seperti bobobox ditempat lain. kamar bersih, sudah ada 2 handuk dan di kamar mandi ada sabun&shampoo. cuma enggak ada sikat gigi. kamar mandi juga bau banget, kurang bersih juga. tempat sholat sama ruang makan di lntai 3 horor soalnya jendela enggak ada tirainya dan atapnya bolong. mohon diperbaiki lagi ya"

Or how come they look like they're wearing pajamas and wearing training and a t-shirt, is the uniform also a sleeping uniform? Complicated verification using a photo of your ID card with your face, for a hotel class, it shouldn't be this complicated because you only need to give your ID card, if you verify a photo of your ID card with your face, it's like you're going to borrow money, I'm afraid the data will be leaked and misused",2 years,Bobopod Pancoran Jakarta,"pinggiran sela sela kasur kotor, enggak dibersihin,bantal melempem melebihi bantal anak kos, susah banget hubungi resepsionisnya bro, dari fitur chat diaplikasi enggak bisa. mencari no telf bobobox pncoran di google di telf juga enggak bisa, masa harus turun naik untuk hal hal begitu saja, nguras tenaga sih,  abangnya sih oke oke saja, tapi memang kalo di bobobox tuh enggak pakai seragam ya?atau bagaimana kok kayak pakai baju tidur begitu pakai training dan kaos, apa seragamnya juga seragam tidur??  vertifikasi ribet pakai foto ktp dengan muka, untuk sekelas hotel seharusnya enggak perlu seribet ini sih karena cukup mengasih ktp saja, kalo vertifikasi foto ktp dengan muka sudah kayak lagi mau pinjol, takut data bocor dan disalahgunakan saja sih"

I booked a sky double room using the bobobox application at a price of 200 (there is a first-time use discount). the bed is quite comfortable and clean. the mattress is big and soft. previously I thought that the room would be very small. eh, it turns out that the space to move is still quite free. we just checked this at around 01.00 am. when we got there we were immediately greeted warmly by the security guard. after that we went in and immediately checked this. starting from checking in, access to the room, locker facilities, conditions in the room, if you want to access anything, just use the application on your cellphone. even the setting of the night light is via the application. cool! when you enter the room, the atmosphere is very futuristic. ten years ago I never imagined that there would be a hotel with ""digital"" access like this. salute! we enter another important part, namely the bathroom. for the shared bathroom, it is quite clean and looks diligently cleaned. in total in the women's bathroom there are 2 toilets and 2 showers. oh yeah, if you are here you have to change your footwear that has been provided in each locker. access the locker using the qr code in the application. this is also what makes the bobopod inn clean. if you are a breakfast team, don't be restless and anxious. the price you pay also includes breakfast. there are two types: cereal and bread. when taking the food is also made happy. for cereal there is cococrunch complete with small packaged ultra uht milk. for bread you get two slices complete with strawberry and chocolate jam, and there is a small knife. great! unfortunately, forgot to take a photo of the sky double room that was occupied yesterday :(",2 months,Bobopod Paskal Bandung,"pengalaman pertama dan sangat berkesan ketika nginap di bobopod paskal, bandung. sebenarnya, ini bukan kali pertama nginap di hotel kapsul. tapi jujur pas nginap di bobopod paskal langsung dibuat terpesona.  saya booking kamar sky double pakai aplikasi bobobox di harga 200 (ada diskon pemakaian pertama kali). untuk tempat tidurnya termasuk nyaman dan bersih. kasurnya besar dan empuk. sebelumnya sempat ngira kalo kamarnya bakal kecil banget. eh, ternyata ruang geraknya masih cukup leluasa.  kami baru cek ini sekitar jam 01.00 pagi. sampai di sana langsung disambut hangat sama bapak satpam. setelah itu masuk dan langsung cek ini. mulai dari cek-ini, akses ke kamar, fasilitas loker, kondisi dalam kamar, mau akses apa pun tinggal pakai aplikasi di handphone. bahkan pengaturan lampu tidurnya pun lewat aplikasi. keren! pas masuk ruang kamar, suasananya futuristik banget. sepuluh tahun lalu enggak pernah terbayang kalo bakal ada hotel dengan akses ""sedigital"" ini. salut!  kita masuk ke bagian yang penting lain, yaitu kamar mandi. untuk kamar mandi sharing, di sini termasuk bersih dan kelihatan rajin dibersihkan. total di kamar mandi perempuan ada 2 toilet dan 2 tempat mandi. oh iya, kalo di sini harus ganti alas kaki yang sudah disediakan di masing-masing loker. akses lokernya pakai qr code yang ada di aplikasi. ini juga yang bikin penginapan bobopod bersih.  kalau kamu tim sarapan, jangan resah dan gelisah. harga yang kamu bayar juga termasuk sarapan. ada dua jenis: sereal dan roti. pas ambil makanannya juga dibikin senang. untuk sereal ada cococrunch lengkap sama susu uht ultra kemasan kecil. kalau rotinya dapat dua lembar lengkap sama selai strawberry dan cokelat, dan ada pisau kecil. mantap deh! sayangnya, lupa foto kamar sky double yang ditempatin kemarin :("

I arrived at midnight, and the receptionist was still on standby and quite helpful during the check-in process. quite surprised because the bobobox doesn't have a lift and the stairs are also quite long to carry a 24-inch suitcase, hehehe. the pod bya is great and the wifi also really supports all the internet access needed. it was a bit of a surprise that the location of the toilet was at the very back so I was confused going around the whole room to find the toilet. the design of this bobobox is also quite attractive with all the facilities available and also has a pretty good work space because it is in the outdoor area so it doesn't disturb other guests. great anyway. the location is also strategic 👍",a year,Bobopod Paskal Bandung,"salah satu bobobox yang cukup berbeda dengan teman-teman nya yang pernah saya kunjungi sebelumnya. tapi so far saya mendapatkan pengalaman yang cukup baik disini.  saya datang pada tengah malam, dan receptionist masih stand by dan cukup helpful pada proses check ini. cukup terkejut karena bobobox nya enggak ada lift dan tangganya juga cukup panjang untuk bawa koper yang 24inch, hehehe. pod bya mantap dan wifi nya juga sangat mendukung segala akses internet yang dibutuhkan.  agak suprise lokasi toilet nya ada di paling belakang sehingga sempat kebingungan memutari seluruh ruangan untuk mencari toilet. design bobobox ini juga cukup menarik dengan segala fasilitas yang tersedia dan juga punya works space yang cukup bagus karena ada di outdoor area sehingga tidak menganggu guest lainnya. mantap pokoknya. lokasi nya juga strategis 👍"

Auliya Aurora,3.0,"I have stayed here twice, also at Bobocabin Cikole. But unfortunately when I checked in on Thursday, March 16, 2023, the female receptionist on the morning shift did not allow us to leave our belongings. Even though we had a plan to arrive at 10 am, leave our belongings and continue our travel agenda. Even though it was said that the suitcase was locked and there were no valuables, the female receptionist still did not allow us to leave our belongings on the pretext that someone had to wait for the items. Here I was surprised, but because I was tired, I finally gave in and waited for this check-in time. Automatically all my plans were postponed just like that. After waiting for 1 hour, a new guest arrived and immediately left his belongings with the male receptionist who was on standby at the counter. And it was allowed, there was even a luggage storage form. The items that were left were also very many compared to me who only had a small suitcase and a tote bag filled with toiletries. Here I am very disappointed because I feel lied to and played, I lost time and material because my event was forced to be postponed for 1 hour. Does the female receptionist not want to have more work? To the point of not wanting to accept our deposit of goods? It turns out there is a form, does that mean it is permissible to deposit goods? Is it just because she is lazy and doesn't want to be bothered that she lied to the guests? Please brief the female receptionist staff. I am really disappointed with her service.",a year,Bobopod Paskal Bandung,"sudah 2 kali stay disini, di bobocabin cikole juga. tapi sangat disayangkan pada saat saya check ini di hari kamis 16 maret 23, staff receptionist wanita yang shift pagi hari itu tidak mengizinkan kami untuk menitip barang. padahal kami sudah ada rencana begitu sampai jam 10 pagi, titip barang dan melanjutkan agenda prjalanan kami. meskipun sudah dibilang bahwa koper dikunci dan tidak ada barang brharga pun, staff receptionist wanitu itu tetap tidak mengizinkan kami untuk menitipkan barang dengan dalih harus ada orang yang menunggu barangnya. disini saya sudah merasa heran, namun karena sudah capek akhirnya saya mengalah dan menunggu jam check ini saja. otomatis semua rncana saya diundur begitu saja.  setelah menunggu 1 jam, ada tamu yang baru datang dan langsung menitipkan barangnya kepada staff receptionist laki-laki yang baru standby di counter. dan diperbolehkan, bahkan ada form  penitipan barang pula. barang yang dititipkan pun sangat banyak dibandingkan saya yang cuma koper kecil dan tas totebag isi peralatan mandi.  disini saya sangat kecewa karena merasa dibohongi dan dipermainkn, saya rugi waktu dan materi karena acara saya trpaksa doundur 1 jam. apa receptionist wanitu tersebut enggak mau kerjaannya brtambah? sampai enggak mau menerima titipan barang kami? ada formnya ternyata, berarti memang boleh titip barang kan? cuma karena dia malas saja dan enggak mau ribet sampai bohongin tamu?  tolong dibriefing diperingati staff receptionist wanita tersebut. saya benar-benar kecewa dengan pelayanannya."

Dian Adriani David,3.0,"It seems that this automatic system makes the presence of employees at the front desk not too important. At least the impression I got is that the ux of the application should be understandable by ourselves, no need to be explained by employees. So, if you stay here, you don't need to expect a friendly greeting from employees like in a hotel :) This time I booked a single pod, located on the 2nd floor, so I needed to lift my suitcase to the 2nd floor. When I got to the 2nd floor, I happened to get pod number 42. And number 42, is one of the 2 numbers that is not on the map :) So I had to go back and forth dragging my suitcase to find the pod. The pod itself is probably the reason I booked this capsule hotel. For a capsule hotel, the room is comfortable, and it has easy access to the airport. Additional notes for the prayer room area. Both outside the prayer room area (communal area) and the prayer room floor itself, are muddy when it rains. The good point is, the security guards are really good and friendly. Starting from parking, unloading suitcases, leaving items, everything is provided well and with a full smile by the security guard :)",a year,Bobopod Paskal Bandung,"agaknya sistem yang otomatis ini membuat kehadiran karyawan di front desk tidak terlalu penting ya. setidaknya kesan yang saya dapat adalah bahwa ux dari aplikasinya harus bisa kita pahami sendiri, tidak perlu dijelaskan oleh karyawan. jadi, ya kalau menginap di sini tidak perlu berharap sapaan ramah dari karyawan seperti di hotel :)  kali ini saya memesan single pod, letaknya di lantai 2, jadi saya perlu mengangkat koper ke lantai 2. sampai di lantai 2, kebetulan sekali saya dapat pod no 42. dan no 42, adalah salah 2 nomor yang tidak ada di denahnya :) jadi saya harus bolak balik menggeret koper untuk mencari podnya.  podnya sendiri adalah mungkin alasan saya untuk memesan hotel kapsul ini. untuk ukuran hotel kapsul, kamarnya nyaman, dan aksesnya mudah menuju bandara.  tambahan catatan untuk area mushala. baik di luar area mushala (area communal) dan lantai mushalanya sendiri, becek ketika hujan.  good pointnya adalah, satpamnya benar-benar baik dan ramah. dari mulai parkir, turunin koper, nitip barang, semua diprovide dengan baik dan full senyum oleh satpam :)"

shenyamnyam,5.0,"when I went to Bandung I was confused about finding a cheap and comfortable place to stay, finally I opened the Agoda application and found a place called Bobobox. The first time I stayed here I really liked the concept, it was different from the others, which I thought would be expensive but it turned out to be pocket-friendly for a backpacker 😁 finally booked at the Paskal location which turned out to be not that far from the city center so it was strategic to go everywhere. for the bathroom it was shared with others and outside the room, so it didn't join the room. for the room it was like a box, there were sky and earth models, I happened to choose the sky model. so the mattress was on top while the table for stepping on and the mirror were in front of it, it looked small but it was enough for solo travel. for breakfast the hotel did not prepare it and eating in the room was not allowed, only in the place that had been provided. the hotel also did not provide a refrigerator for storing food so if possible unfinished food had to be thrown away. the hotel also provides a place to pray for Muslims. drinking water is provided on each floor and it is outside the relaxation room. so if possible bring a tumbler, because I happened to not bring one, I ended up just buying drinking water across the hotel. for minimarkets there are across the hotel and for non-Muslims there is a church across the hotel ☺ for those who are simple, you can definitely stay here, have a nice holiday ☺",2 years,Bobopod Paskal Bandung,"waktu ke bandung aku bingung cari tempat nginep yang murah dan enak, akhirnya buka aplikasi agoda terus nemu tempat nemu bobobox. pertama kali nginep  disini aku suka banget sama konsepnya beda dari yang lain, yang aku kira itu bakalan mahal tapi ternyata ramah di kantong untuk seorang backpacker 😁  akhirnya pesan di lokasi paskal yang ternyata enggak begitu jauh dari tengah kota jadi ke mana-mana strategis. untuk kamar mandinya itu sharing dengan yang lain dan diluar kamar, jadi enggak gabung dengan kamarnya.  untuk kamarnya seperti box ada yang model sky dan earth, kebetulan aku pilih yang model sky. jadi kasurnya di atas sedangkan meja untuk pinjakan dan kaca ada di depannya terlihat seperti kecil tapi sangat cukup untuk solo travel. untuk sarapan pihak hotel tidak menyiapkan dan untuk makan di kamar itu tidak di perbolehkan, hanya boleh di tempat yang sudah di sediakan.  pihak hotel juga tidak menyediakan kulkas untuk penyimpanan makanan jadi sebisa mungkin makanan yang tidak habis harus di buang. di hotel juga menyediakan tempat untuk sholat bagi yang muslim.  disetiap lantai disediakan air minum dan itu ada diluar ruang tempat bersantai. jadi sebisa mungkin bawa tumbler, karena kebetulan aku enggak bawa akhirnya hanya beli air minum di sebrang hotel.  untuk minimarket ada di sebrang hotel dan bagi yang non muslim ada gereja di sebrang hotel ☺  untuk yang simpel boleh banget nginep disini ya, selamat berlibur ☺"

Furthermore, the waiters are friendly and alert if anyone needs help. thirdly, the price is quite affordable. For those who don't have a bigger budget, but want to sleep comfortably enough, that's fine. However, this could be a consideration because this hotel is a capsule hotel so the sound from other capsules is quite audible. Indeed, the hotel has ordered guests to maintain order at night, if I'm not mistaken from 9 pm to 7 am. But yes, there are people who don't know the rules and don't have ethics. like my last experience, there was a group of very noisy young people running around the capsule corridor, laughing loudly in the middle of the night or close to dawn, around 2am as a result, sleep was disturbed. So if you're sensitive to sounds, that's something to consider.",2 years,Bobopod Paskal Bandung,"sudah beberapa kali kesini, karena pertama lokasinya strategis. dekat sekali sama stasiun bandung. banyak tempat makan disekitarnya. selanjutnya, pelayannya ramah dan sigap kalau ada yang butuh bantuan. ketiga, harganya yang cukup terjangkau. buat yang enggak punya budget lebih, tapi pengin tidur cukup nyaman sih, boleh lah. hanya saja, ini bisa jadi pertimbangan karena hotel ini, hotel kapsul jadi suara dari kapsul lain cukup kedengaran. memang dari hotelnya sudah pesan ke tamu untuk menjaga ketertiban saat malam hari, kalau saya tidak salah dari jam 9 malam sampai jam 7 pagi. tapi ya, yang namanya manusia ada saja yang enggak tau aturan dan enggak punya etika. seperti pengalaman saya terkahir, ada 1 rombongan anak muda yang super berisik berlarian di koridor kapsul, tertawa keras2  di tengah malam atau mendekati subuh, sekitarjam 2'an alhasil tidurpun terganggu. jadi kalau sensitif dengan suara2 sih, jadi pertimbangan deh ini."

Berlianka Adena,3.0,"for backpackers this place is really good, the wifi is also fast, the guard is also quick when you want to check in, he explained the features and how to use them. the hotel concept is also unique and cool when you enter the pod. the location is also strategic on jalan selamat riyadi. for the price I think it's quite worth it👍🏻 in my opinion there are several things that the hotel really needs to improve, - yesterday when I stayed I didn't get a toothbrush/amenities, I don't know if I forgot or there weren't any, but I read the review that it was given. - actually I don't have a problem with the concept of sharing toilets. it's just that I'm reluctant to go to the toilet because it's not cleaned regularly, the tissue runs out and isn't refilled, the trash is full and isn't thrown away, the floor is muddy and isn't mopped, lots of hair isn't cleaned, and the toilet is a damp place I'm even more reluctant and disgusted because there are lots of worms on the walls. - the parking lot in my opinion is really minus, there are no parking guards so it's very difficult to move the motorbike, especially if it's locked with the handlebars. Once there was a parking attendant who was really aggressive, didn't even help him move the motorbike, even though he had already paid for it at the hotel (fyi, parking is paid using qris in the hotel, 6k per night) - if it's after 12 o'clock, the guard isn't standing by. So if you need anything, you have to wait first. It's not really a problem, but at least it has a bell or button so people don't have a hard time finding it.",3 months,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"untuk backpackeran tempat ini oke banget, wifi juga kencang, penjaganya juga gercep pas mau check ini dijelasin fitur2 dan cara pakainya bagaimana. konsep hotel ya juga unik dan keren kwtika sudah masuk di podnya. lokasinya juga strategis di jalan selamat riyadi. untuk harga menurut saya ini cukup worth it👍🏻 menurut saya ada beberapa hal yang wajib banget diimprove pihak hotel, - kemarin waktu saya menginap gadapet sikat gigi/amenities entah lupa atau memang enggak ada, tapi saya baca reviewnya ada dikasih. - sebenarnya saya tidak jadi masalah dengan konsep toilet sharing. hanya saja saya jadi enggan ke toilet karena tidak rutin dibersihkan, tissue habis tidak direfill, sampah sudah penuh tidak dibuang, lantai becek tidak dipel, banyak rambut tidak dibersihkan, dan toilet adalah tempat yang lembab saya makin enggan dan jijik karena banyak cacing di tembok. - tempat parkir menurut saya ini minus banget, penjaga parkir tidak ada jadi sulit sekali mindahin motor apalagi di kunci stang. sekalinya ada tukang parkir galak benar, bantuin mindah motor juga kagak, padahal sudah bayar di hotel (fyi parkir bayar pakai qris di dalam hotel, permalam 6k) - kalau sudah di atas jam 12, penjaga enggak stand by. jadi kalo perlu apa-apa harus menunggu dulu. bukan masalah banget, tapi setidaknya dikasih bell atau tombol biar orang enggak susah nyariinnya."

Siti Fitriyani,4.0,"advantages: - the room was nice and clean - the room is not too narrow, it turns out that the mattress part is even a single room type - earth room is better than sky room for me, because it takes effort to go up to the mattress and the stairs are small - the service was excellent , any complaints are responded to immediately - you can leave your belongings even after checking out, so you can walk around while waiting for the train to return - the location is strategic, there are many famous restaurants and near the bus stop, so it's easy to go everywhere.  Disadvantages: - the bathroom, especially in the shower booth (especially the girl's) is dirty, the edge/corner of the floor looks dirty and there are traces of hair left behind and it's like it wasn't cleaned like that, I don't know if they brush the floor or not after cleaning.

In my opinion, the bathroom is a very crucial thing in an accommodation, next time I don't think I will go back unless there is an improvement from the management. - the fan in the mosque room is also broken, it feels hot especially when the lights are on.  overall, it's okay but not the first time if I do it again. all because of the huft bathroom..",4 months,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"kelebihan : - the room was nice and clean - ruangannya enggak terlalu sempit kok ternyata di bagian kasurnya walaupun tipe single room - earth room is better tahan sky room for me, karena butuh effort buat naik ke atas kasurnya dan tangganya kecil - the service was excellent, ada komplain langsung ditanggapi - bisa nitip barang walaupun sudah check out, jadi bisa jalan-jalan dulu sembari menunggu jadwal kereta pulang - lokasinya strategis, banyak tempat makan terkenal dan dekat halte bus, jadi gampang kemana-mana.  kekurangan : - kamar mandinya terutama di shower booth (terkhusus yang cewek) kotor, bagian pinggiran/pojokan lantainya kelihatan kotor dan ada bekas rambut yang tertinggal dan kayak enggak dibersihin begitu, gue enggak tau sih mereka nyikat lantainya apa enggak pas ngebersihin. sumpah gregetan lihatnya, pengin tak bersihin sendiri rasanya. kamar mandi menurut gue hal yang cukup krusial sih dari sebuah penginapan, next time kayaknya sih enggak bakal balik lagi kecuali ada improvement dari pihak pengelolanya. - kipas di ruangan mushollanya juga rusak, berasa panas apalagi kalo lampunya nyala.  overall, oke sih tapi enggak dulu deh kalo buat balik lagi. semua gara-gara kamar mandi huft.."

Vera Dian Mutiara,1.0,"no issues with the room, service and location. choose bobobox because it is close to the pocari tourism run venue which will start at the triwindu market, coincidentally when searching this pod hotel appeared. in terms of the segment called pod hotel, the target market is middle low. backpackers from abroad who certainly do not bring vehicles or maybe local tourists around central java whose transportation can be taken by motorbike and certainly will not be an issue for parking. but, for some people including me who stopped by solo by car. we really did not feel uncomfortable with the treatment of the parking attendant in front of the hotel. from the beginning we were informed that we were staying at bobobox, with the reason that Sunday was car free day along jl selamat riyadi we were ""forced"" to move the car to the mcd which was located before the hotel (meaning we had to find a detour because it was one way). I parked when I checked in at 2, then walked to find food in the keprabon area at 5. when we went home the same parking attendant, a man with a not so tall posture with long hair in a ponytail and wearing a hat again ""intimidated"" us and asked when the car would be moved? finally I got angry and asked him to come to the reception because at the time of check-in at the beginning I was informed ""if the parking attendant asks just say it's from us"" thank you to the hotel for providing a solution, but it's a big no to stay here again considering the parking attendant who is more like a thug doesn't like ""his parking lot"" being used for hours i mean, if we stay at the hotel, it's impossible to park for 1-2 hours like a sex hotel.",9 months,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"tidak ada issue dengan kamar, service dan lokasinya. pilih bobobox karena dekat dengan venue pocari tourism run yang akan start di pasar triwindu, kebetulan pas search muncul pod hotel ini. secara segmen yang namanya pod hotel target marketnya middle low. backpacker dari luar negeri yang pastinya tidak membawa kendaraan atau mungkin tourist lokal sekitaran jawa tengah yang transportnya bisa ditempuh dengan motor dan pastinya tidak akan menjadi issue untuk parkiran.  tapi, untuk sebagain orang termasuk saya yang mampir ke solo dengan menggunakan mobil. kami benar-benar tidak merasa tidak nyaman dengan perlakuan petugas parkir di depan hotel. dari awal kami sudah info bahwa kami menginap di bobobox, dengan alasan hari minggu car free day disepanjang jl selamat riyadi kami “dipaksa” untuk memindahkan mobil ke mcd yang letaknya sebelum hotel (artinya kami harus cari jalan memutar karena one way). saya parkir saat check ini jam 2, kemudian jalan kaki cari makan didaerah keprabon jam 5an. saat pulang petugas parkir yang sama, bpk dengan postur yang tidak begitu tinggi rambut di kuncir panjang dan memakai topi kembali “mengintimidasi” kami dan menanyakan kapan mobil mau dipindahin? akhirnya saya marah dan meminta dia ikut ke reception karena waktu check ini diawal saya diinfo “kalo petugas parkirnya tanya bilang saja sudah dari kami”  terimakasih kepada pihak hotel yang sudah memberikan solusi, but it’s big no untuk stay disini lagi mengingat petugas parkir yang lebih mirip dengan preman itu tidak suka “lahan parkirnya” dipakai berjam2  i mean, kita nginep dihotel ya enggak mungkin lah parkir 1-2 jam semacam hotel esek2."

I Benedicta Maggie,5.0,"for the first time staying in a capsule hotel, yesterday ordered a double bed, so it's less cramped 🤣. new experience, to enter the room you have to scan a qr code like that. inside the pod there is a panel for locking, bluetooth speaker, light settings, etc. can connect to our gadgets. for the size of the pod it turns out it's not that small, for the height of the sleeping area up to the chest (100cm) there is also a minimalist table and chair. the bed and bathroom are clean (shared bathroom). well, coincidentally yesterday the pod's AC wasn't too cold, and there was a faint damp aroma. for the price of 130 thousand / night, no comment 🤣. oh yeah there is a curfew, around 10 please be quiet. the downside of staying in a capsule hotel is the shaking, you can hear the other side hitting. open and close the door / phone call the sound is heard.",a year,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"untuk pertama kali nginep di kapsul hotel, kemarin pesan yang double bed, supaya less sesak 🤣. pengalaman baru, untuk masuk kamar harus scan qr code begitu. di dalam pod ada panel buat ngelock, bluetooth speaker, pengaturan cahaya, dll bisa connect ke gadget kita.  untuk ukuran podnya ternyata enggak se kecil itu, untuk tinggi area tidur se dada (100cm) ada meja kursi minimalisnya juga.  kasur dan kamar mandi bersih (kamar mandi bersama ya). nah kebetulan kemarin podnya acnya enggak terlalu dingin, dan ada samar² aromanya lembab.  untuk harga 130rb/ malam sih no comment ya 🤣. oiyaa ada jam malam, sekitar pukul 10 harap tenang.  minusnya nginep di hotel kapsul gelodakan, kedengaran sebelah mengapai. buka tutup pintu/ teleponan suaranya terdengar."

Defri Duantika,3.0,"The location is strategic because it is in the city center. Before entering the pod, you have to change your footwear and put your shoes in the locker. Check-in is only possible at 2 o'clock if you arrive before that, you have to wait. The prayer room and dining area are on the 3rd floor. If you can't eat in the pod, you have to go to the dining area. Because I only had a short stay, I didn't have time to explore the other floors. I occupied a sky single room. I thought the stairs to go up were big, but it turned out to be in the corner and very small, it was a bit scary to climb the stairs. The mattress was clean, but when I checked in, there was a visitor who complained because the mattress had a lot of hair, so they asked for it to be replaced. The AC is cold, the lighting features are good, the sound is also good, the wifi is quite fast, only the bluetooth speaker doesn't work. The bathroom is at the end of the hall on each floor, there is a cubicle for showering and just a tub/defecation. The cleanliness is lacking and it smells a bit.",a year,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"secara lokasi tempatnya strategis karena di pusat kota. sebelum masuk pod harus tukar alas kaki dan naroh sepatu di loker. check ini baru bisa jam 2 kalo datang sebelum itu ya menunggu. mushola dan tempat makan ada di lantai. 3 kalo makan gaboleh di pod harus ke tempat makannya. karena saya cuma sebentar enggak sempat eksplor ke lantai lainnya.  saya menempati kamar sky single. saya kira tangga buat naiknya besar ternyata mojok dan kecil banget agak ngeri naik tangganya. kasurnya bersih, tapi pas saya check ini ada pengunjung yang komplain karena kasurnya banyak rambutnya, jadi meminta diganti. ac nya dingin, fitur lampu baik, suara juga baik, wifi termasuk kencang, hanya bluetooth speakernya enggak berfungsi.  kamar mandi di ujung lorong tiap lantai, ada bilik untuk mandi dan sekedar bak/bab. kebersihannya kurang ya dan agak berbau."

It is really enough for backpackers who just want to sleep and not for a staycation.

There are a total of 3 floors, then the top floor has a small musholla, so there is a place for ablution, whether the canteen is provided with cutlery as well. very complete, plus a strategic location. oiya is also available to drink at the dispenser and you can choose whether you want hot, medium or cool. comfortable poll, only yes dear there is no parking space, so put the motorbike in front and leave the helmet to the receptionist. It's safe for motorbikes outside, pay 3,000 for parking, but if the person is different, they will ask you to pay again like that. so the bottom line is 3,000 per day. access to the road is a bit difficult because it is on a road that is like that so you have to turn around if you are late. but so far so good, i recommend you to visit there.",a year,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"aku pesan yang kamar singlenya, terus dapat yang di sky. tapi agak susah ya naiknya, karena enggak ada tangga khususnya. tertulis juga suruh hati-hati. dapat alat sikat gigi dan pasta gigi nya. ada kamar mandi umum yang dibedain menurut genre. di kamar mandi juga ada hairdryer terus ada sabun plus sampo. total ada 3 lantai, terus lantai teratas ada musholla kecil begitu sudah ada tempat wudhu nya sama ada canteen disediakan alat makan juga loh. lengkap banget, ditambah lokasi yang strategis habis. oiya disediakan minum juga di dispenser dan bisa pilih mau yang hot medium atau cool. nyaman poll, cuma ya sayang enggak ada tempat parkirnya, jadi motor taruh didepan terus helm dititipin ke resepsionis. aman sih motor diluar bayar parkir 3rb tapi kalo orangnya beda nanti suruh bayar lagi begitu. jadi intinya sehari 3rb deh. akses jalannya agak susah karena dia tuh di jalan yang secara begitu lo jadi kudu muter-muter kalo sampai kelewatan. but so far so good, i recommend lu to visit there."

Maybe it can be an evaluation material too. The prayer room and dining area are on the 3rd floor, while those on the 1st floor have to climb quite a high staircase. It's not because I'm lazy to climb the stairs, but it should also be considered if there are families staying here. It so happened that when I stayed there were several families staying too. It should be considered again. Overall, the pods and others are nice! It's worth it for those who want to backpack or do short trips.",a year,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"yang saya suka dari bobobox ini tempatnya berada di kawasan yang ramai, jadi kemana2 gampang. sayangnya bobobox di solo enggak ada lift. mungkin bisa jadi bahan evaluasi juga. musholla dan area makan ada di lantai 3, sementara yang berada di lantai 1 harus naik tangga lumayan tinggi. bukan karena malas naik yangga ya, harus diperhatikan juga kalau ada keluarga yang nginep di sini. kebetulan waktu saya nginep ada beberapa keluarga yang nginep juga. harus diperhatikan lagi ya. overall pods dan lainnya enak kok! worth it yang mau backpacker atau travelling singkat."

I hope bobobox gets better in the future, thank you!",a year,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"tempatnya cukup strategis, gampang ditemuin. dekat sama tempat makan dan tempat jajan karena dekat sama sekolah juga. harga oke. kamarnya bersih dan dingin. bisa dengar sound effect di pods nya dan bisa bantu relaxasi juga.  cuma minusnya di podsnya enggak ada tv ya, jadi memang menurutku bobobox cocok buat istirahat dan nyantai, karena space nya juga enggak besar menurutku kurang cocok buat keluarga.  kamar mandinya bersih, ada hairdryer nya juga. tapi untuk klosetnya enggak pakai jetshower ya, modelnya yang pancurannya langsung dari klosetnya begitu, dan please jangan buang air di lantai kalau enggak biasa pakai kloset yang di bobobox pakai ya🤗 mungkin part ini bisa jadi saran juga nih buat tim bobobox supaya toilet dan kamar mandi tetap bersih dan nyaman tapi bisa dipakai sama semua kalangan😊  oiya pelayanannya juga oke ya, kita dijelasin secara detail penggunaan aplikasi dan cara scan qr untuk masuk ke podsnya. semoga bobobox makin baik kedepannya ya, thank you!"

Cat Person,1.0,"as a loyal user of bobobox, bobobox solo is the most uncomfortable. especially because the absence of parking space makes us have to pay 30 for each time parking a motorbike when parking, not after exiting the parking lot. we finally have to talk to the parking attendant and give 15.0 for 3 days of staying with the note that there is no need to charge parking again every time parking. but that is also not without a smooth way too. in the future will not return to bobobox solo if there are still issues like this.",a year,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"sebagai pengguna setia bobobox, bobobox solo paling tidak nyaman. terutama karena ketiadaan lahan parkir membuat kita harus membayar 30 untuk setiap kali parkir motor saat parkir, bukan setelah keluar parkir ya. kita yang akhirnya harus bicara dengan tukang parkir dan memberikan 15,0 untuk 3 hari menginap dengan catatan tidak perlu ada tarik parkir lagi setiap parkir. tapi itu juga bukannya tidak dengan cara yang smooth juga.  kedepannya tidak akan kembali lagi ke bobobox solo apabila masih ada issue seperti ini."

It's better for those who bring cars to stay at a hotel that clearly provides parking",2 years,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"hotelnya sih worth it ya, tapi yang buat bawa mobil no rekomendasi sih menurut aku, soalnya bayar parkirnya enggak jelas, sore check ini ditarik 10rb terus pas besoknya check out ditarik 15rb lagi sudah mengasih harganya enggak ngotak tapi penjagaan dari tukang parkirnya enggak ada. padahal kata karyawan hotelnya penjagaan dari mereka tapi tukang parkirnya yang mengasih harganya enggak masuk akal. seharusnya dari pihak pemerintah solonya harus lebih tegas lagi ya. soalnya jatuhnya kayak pungli hehe. biasanya pakai bobobox yang di semarang ataupun bandung parkirnya juga aman"" saja. mending yang bawa mobil di hotel"" yang sudah jelas disediain parkiran saja deh"

Hari Budi Wijaya,5.0,"bobobox selamat riyadi solo is located right, easily accessible by public transportation. if either the solo trans batik bus can get off at the ngarsopuro bus stop (opposite the solo bobobox) this is in front of mc di then cross and walk a little or the pon/mc di market bus stop (in a row with the solo bobobox). if taking the bus from the east, you can get off at the lapangan puncak bus stop and take corridor 1, if taking from the tirtonadi terminal, you can take the blue solo trans batik at the east shelter then transit at lapangan paha. if taking the train, get off at purwosari or balap station, just get on from the nearest bus stop then you can ask the driver to go to the pon or ngarsopuro market bus stop whether you can go directly or transit first. for culinary activists, this solo bobobox is close to nasi liwet wongso lemu, soto triwindu, timlo maestro can be reached on foot. for the bathroom there is still separate soap and shampoo, different from other boboboxes that already have 2in1 soap and shampoo.

Febrian Tantya Putra,5.0,"stayed 1 night at this hotel for the first time, the first impression was comfortable. the explanation from the FO was very clear and understandable. no need to give a deposit when checking in, after being given an explanation, you can go straight to the room. the key you get is only a locker key to change sandals/shoes with footwear that must be worn while in the hotel. the room key uses a qr-code in the application. I got a room on the 2nd floor, sky pod 1 person, small but comfortable. at first I was confused about how to go up, because the space is quite narrow so it takes a little effort to go up, especially for people who have a body capacity that is more than usual. in the room there are toiletries provided, such as towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mineral water, for soap, shampoo, and hair dryers are provided in the bathroom. there are also two plugs near the window, I think it's enough to charge your cellphone and laptop. there is not much space to move in the room, what must be remembered is the head. for the bathroom, sharing, separated between men and women. for the men's bathroom, at night, it is still clean, there is no trash at all. but when the next day, garbage started to appear and was left alone, I think this is a matter of individual responsibility. the water is clean, can be hot and cold, there are no complaints at all about the water. in the bathroom, there are hangers and a flat place to put things. there is indeed no special smoking area in this hotel, but on the 2nd floor, near the bathroom there is an open area. on the 3rd floor there is a pantry and prayer room, clean, but the trash can is small so there is a lot of garbage piled up there, even though it is a place to eat. plates, spoons, cups are provided, complete with washing soap, but it could be better if hand soap was provided. there is a microwave and water heater too. there is no parking, so those who bring vehicles, especially cars, must dare to park on the side of the main road. since I don't use a vehicle, so I don't know how much the parking rate is. overall good, an economical choice for resting, cold air conditioning and fast internet connection",3 years,Bobopod Slamet Riyadi Solo,"menginap 1 malam di hotel ini untuk pertama kali, kesan pertamanya nyaman. penjelasan dari fo sangat jelas dan dapat dimengerti dengan baik. tidak perlu memberikan deposit saat checkin, setelah diberikan penjelasan, bisa langsung ke kamar. kunci yang didapatkan hanya kunci loker untuk mengganti sendal/ sepatu dengan alas kaki yang diwajibkan dipakai selama di hotel. kunci kamar menggunakan qr-code yang ada di aplikasi. saya mendapat kamar di lantai 2, sky pod 1 orang, kecil tapi nyaman. awalnya bingung naiknya bagaimana, karena ruang yang cukup sempit sehingga membutuhkan sedikit usaha untuk naik ke atas, terutama bagi orang yang memiliki kapasitas badan yang lebih dari biasanya. di kamar sudah disediakan peralatan mandi, seperti handuk, sikat gigi, odol, dan air mineral, untuk sabun, shampo, dan pengering rambut disediakan di kamar mandi. disediakan pula dua colokan di dekat jendela, saya rasa cukup untuk charge handphone dan laptop. ruang gerak di kamar tidak banyak, yang harus diingat adalah kepala. untuk kamar mandi, sharing, dibedakan antara pria dan wanita. untuk kamar mandi pria, di malam hari, masih bersih, tidak ada sampah sama sekali. tapi ketika keesokan hari, sampah mulai muncul dan ditinggalkan begitu saja, saya rasa ini masalah tanggung jawab individu. airnya bersih, bisa panas dan dingin, tidak ada keluhan sama sekali mengenai air. di dalam kamar mandi, ada gantungan dan tempat datar untuk menaruh barang. memang tidak ada area khusus merokok di hotel ini, namun di lantai 2, dekat kamar mandi ada area terbuka. di lantai 3 ada pantry dan mushola, bersih, tapi tempat sampahnya kecil sehingga banyak sampah yang ditumpuk di situ, padahal tempat makan. disediakan piring, sendok, cangkir, lengkap dengan sabun cucinya, namun bisa lebih baik lagi jika disediakan sabun cuci tangan. ada microwave dan water heater juga. untuk parkiran memang tidak ada, jadi yang membawa kendaraan, terutama mobil harus berani parkir di pinggir jalan besar. berhubung saya tidak menggunakan kendaraan, jadi tidak tahu tarif parkirnya berapa. overall good, pilihan yang hemat untuk beristirahat, ac dingin dan koneksi internet yang cepat"

Their mobility is too noisy for us who sleep below because the space is really that thin.

When I went to the girl's bathroom at night, it smelled bad, but in the morning it was fragrant again, the hot water made me take a really hot bath. haven't tried the communal space because it's just sleeping in (I don't know if the dispenser, microwave, etc. work). overall it's okay for a budget stay, compared to reddoorz sometimes it's more expensive but it's not clean, there's no hot water, parking is difficult 😅 I'll come here again for a budget stay 👍🏻",11 months,Bobopod Tanah Abang Jakarta,"lokasi strategis, ada tempat parkirnya sendiri yang cukup luas, cocok buat yang bawa mobil, parkir kemarin enggak ditarif sih jadi mengasih seikhlasnya. dapat pod di lantai 5, ac dingin, tipe kasur agak keras tapi bersih, jam tenang benaran tenang. pas malam ke kamar mandi cewek bau pesing tapi paginya sudah wangi lagi, air panas buat mandi benaran panas. belum mencoba communal space soalnya memang cuman numpang bobok saja (enggak tau dispenser, microwave, dll berfungsi nggaknya). overall oke sih buat budget stay, dibanding ke reddoorz kadang sudah lebih mahal tapi enggak bersih, enggak ada air panas, parkiran sulit 😅 bakalan kesini lagi sih buat budget stay 👍🏻"

Sincil,3.0,"pod 52's door is hard to open, as a result I was the one who complained to the neighbors because I had to scan it over and over again and it was noisy. Too bad, even though my previous visit pod 20 was really nice, there were no errors, near the window and quiet. If possible, fix pod 52. Later the guests will be the ones who get yelled at by the neighbors because it's noisy. Plus, the front door to the toilet and 2 entrance doors on the 5th floor are broken. So it's not very comfortable, especially the toilet because privacy is disturbed because it can be seen from outside when drying hair using a hairdryer. Hot water is available, but you have to wait a few minutes for the water temperature to change. The room itself is nice, always clean, well-maintained. The AC is also very cold, the room aroma is neutral. Moreover, around bobobox there are lots of food and restaurants (kfc, starbucks, domino, lamian, hokben etc.). Near alfa, indomaret and bank is also really great for staying.",a year,Bobopod Tanah Abang Jakarta,"pod 52 pintunya susah dibuka, alhasil saya yang diprotes sama tetangga gara-gara musti scan ulang-ulang dan berisik. sayang sekali, padahal kunjungan lalu pod 20 enak banget sih, enggak ada eror, dekat jendela dan tenang. diperbaiki ya kalo bisa pod 52. nanti malah tamu yang diomelin tetangga lagi gara-gara berisik. plus, pintu depan toilet dan 2 pintu masuk di lantai 5 rusak. jadinya kurang nyaman, terutama yang toilet karena kan privasi keganggu karena kelihatan dari luar pas ngeringin rambut pakai hairdryer. air panas tersedia, tapi harus menunggu beberapa menit sampai airnya berubah suhu. untuk kamar sendiri enak kok bagus, bersih selalu, terawat. ac juga dingin banget, aroma kamar netral. apalagi sekitar bobobox bertebaran banyak makanan dan resto (kfc, starbucks, domino, lamian, hokben dsb). dekat alfa, indomaret dan bank juga mantap benar buat stay."

hida muslihah,4.0,"take a sky double box, when entering wear special sandals, shoes can be stored in a locker, access via an application on a cellphone, clean comfortable room, lighting and sound can be adjusted, for air conditioning settings turn the air conditioning hole on the ceiling, although small but comfortable for resting, friendly and fast service, need anything can directly chat the host via the application, when you want to get a refill of your drink, the response is fast, so supporting facilities are available, a spacious clean prayer room, a dining room/men's working space equipped with a pantry, microwave, hot and cold dispenser, snacks, drinks, and frozen ready-to-eat food are also available free wifi, clean shared toilet facilities complete with a hair dryer, soap and shampoo, for that price it is really worth it, suitable for those who like backpackers. The location is lined up with Starbucks and KFC, 100m away there is a mini market. My input is only one, I hope there is a policy that regulates guests, when I checked this, there were lots of young couples taking rooms, what's the point of trying, and they didn't bring anything so they weren't travelers, although there's no guarantee that both girls and boys won't do anything, I hope the ease of technology and facilities aren't used for things that aren't good. thanks",2 years,Bobopod Tanah Abang Jakarta,"ambil sky dobel box, ketika masuk pakai sandal khusus, sepatu bisa disimpan di locker, akses melalui aplikasi di hp, kamar bersih nyaman, bisa diatur lighting dan sound nya, untuk pengaturan ac putar lubang ac di plafond, meskipun kecil tapi nyaman untuk istirahat,  pelayanan ramah dan cepat, butuh apa-apa bisa langsung chat host via aplikasi, pas mau ambil refill minum habis responnya cepat, jadi tersedia fasilitas pendukung, mushola luas bersih, ruang makan/cowok working space dilengkapi pantry, microwave, dispenser panas dingin, tersedia pula snack,minuman, dan makanan beku siap saji  free wifi, fasilitas toilet bersama bersih lengkap ada hair dryer sabun shampo, untuk harga segitu whorthed banget, cocok buat yang suka backpacker an. lokasi jejer sama starbucks dan kfc, jarak 100m ada mini market  masukan saya cuma satu, semoga ada kebijakan yang mengatur tamu, ketika saya cek ini, banyak sekali pasangan belia yang ambil room, buat apaaaa coba, dan mereka enggak bawa apa-apa jadi bukan traveller, meskipun enggak jaminan kalo sama-sama ce atau cowok enggak ngapa2 ini juga, semoga kemudahan teknologi dan fasilitas enggak dimanfaatkan untuk hal-hal yang krg baik. trmksh"

Daniel Tarigan,1.0,"when checking out I wanted to leave my stuff but I couldn't. They said it had to be picked up at 11. Oh come on!! What a strange and weird policy. All hostels and capsules in all the countries I've been to don't have such ridiculous rules. The important thing is that the stuff isn't left overnight. Because people can have business until the afternoon. The key system also can't be shared. I tried to share the key with the link several times but the link couldn't be opened. The bathroom smelled of urine. Either because it wasn't cleaned or I just happened to arrive when it hadn't been cleaned. The guests were also very noisy. I complained to the receptionist but they were still uncooperative. Well, that's not the staff's fault. But pls expect that. Very bad attitude from the female receptionist. My fiancé was eating with me and 4 other guests on the 5th floor and the female receptionist even called my fiancé to immediately change our shoes to sandals. There were 6 people on the 5th floor and all of them were wearing shoes including me, but why was my fiancé the only one forced to wear sandals to the point of having to be called and even approached on the 5th floor. But the female receptionist didn't reprimand the other guests. even the guest next to me, who had also checked this, was asked to finish eating first before changing into sandals. but we were not treated the same. really very stiff and unprofessional.",2 years,Bobopod Tanah Abang Jakarta,"pas cek out mau titip barang juga tidak bisa. katanya harus diambil jam 11. oh come on!! what an odd and weird policy. semua hostel dan kapsul di semua negara yang pernah saya datangi tidak punya peraturan sekonyol itu. yang penting barangnya enggak nginep. karena orang bisa saja punya urusan sampai sore.  secara sistem kunci juga tidak bisa dishare. berkali2 mau share kunci dengan link tapi link tidak bisa dibuka.  kamar mandi berbau urin. entah karena tidak dibersihkan atau kebetulan saja saya datang pas belum dibersihkan.  tamu juga sangat berisik. sudah komplain ke resepsionis tapi tetap tidak kooperatif. well itu bukan salah staff. tapi pls expect that.  very bad attitude dari karyawan resepsionis yang perempuan. tunangan saya sedang makan bersama saya dan 4 tamu lainnya di lantai 5 dan resepsionis perempuan tersebut sampai menelpon ke tunangan saya untuk segera mengganti sepatu kami dengan sandal.  ada 6 orang di lantai 5 dan semuanya menggunakan sepatu termasuk saya tapi kenapa cuma tunangan saya yang dipaksa pakai sandal sampai-sampai harus ditelp dan bahkan disamperin di lantai 5.  tapi sih resepsionis perempuan tidak menegur tamu yang lain. malahan tamu di sebelah saya, yang juga sudah cek ini, dipersilahkan menyelesaikan makannya dulu baru ganti sandal. tapi kami tidak diperlakukan sama. sungguh sangat kaku dan tidak profesional."

Robita Annisa,5.0,"The first bobobox pods I visited were here. When I entered the building, I was a bit doubtful, because it looked like an empty and quiet building. However, when I arrived on the 3rd floor, the location of the bobobox was super comfortable. There is a gathering room with a mini canteen. Shoes are not allowed in the room, they must be stored in a locker. Eating is not allowed in the pods/room. I tried the single sky bed. The space to stand, look in the mirror, get on and off the mattress is very narrow, super duper fitting the size of the door. It was difficult to get in and out. The mattress is comfortable, all the facilities function normally. The room temperature is easy to adjust, and the receptionist is responsive and alert. The receptionist service can be accessed via the bobobox application, so you don't need to go in and out of the room. Oh, one thing I really like here. The toilets and showers for male and female guests are separated. So, you don't need to worry about anything. Hehehe. Gallon water is provided, so we just bring a bottle and refill it. Don't forget to bring your cellphone every time you leave the pod (even if it's just to go to the toilet, OK) because access to the pod is via the QR code in the Bobobox application.  so far, i like bobobox. 💕",2 years,Bobopod Tanah Abang Jakarta,"pods bobobox pertama yang kusinggahi ya di sini. pas masuk gedungnya agak meragukan, soalnya kayak bangunan kosong dan sepi saja begitu. tapi, pas sampai di lantai 3, lokasi bobobox-nya, super nyaman sih.  ada ruang ngumpul2 dengan kantin mininya. sepatu enggak boleh masuk kamar, harus disimpan di loker. enggak boleh makan di dalam pods/kamar.  aku coba yang single sky bed. ruang untuk berdiri, becermin, naik-turun kasurnya sempit banget, super duper ngepas dengan ukuran pintu. susah deh pas mau keluar dan masuknya.  kasurnya nyaman, semua fasilitas berfungsi normal. suhu ruangan dan diatur dengan mudah, dan resepsionisnya tanggap serta sigap. layanan resepsionis dapat dijangkau melalui aplikasi bobobox-nya ya, jadi enggak perlu keluar-masuk kamar.  oh 1 hal yang sangat aku suka di sini. toilet dan ruang shower untuk tamu perempuan dan laki-lakinya dipisah loh. jadi, enggak perlu khawatir gimana2 begitu. hehehe.  air galon disediakan, jadi kita tinggal bawa botol, terus isi ulang deh.  jangan lupa bawa ponsel setiap keluar pods (walaupun cuma ke toilet ya) karena akses masuk podsnya lewat qr code dalam aplikasi bobobox-nya.  so far, i like bobobox. 💕"

Adella Diva,4.0,"Overall the place is nice and very strategic. The location is at the Cideng intersection, if you want to find food it's also easy because across the street there is a KFC, walk a little bit to find McDonald's, BK, and Domino's. If you want coffee it's also very easy because the location is next to Starbucks and there's also Chatime. For a capsule hotel, the room is also comfortable, the AC is cold, the toiletries are complete, there is a screen to play nature music and adjust the color of the room lights. There was a bit of a problem with the toilet because it smelled bad like a gutter and there was a tragedy on the first night when the lock in the toilet was loose and couldn't be opened. Luckily, you can chat directly with the officer using the app so the problem was quickly handled. Also, maybe a suggestion to add soundproofing to each room, because on the 2nd night it was a bit disturbed by other visitors who were still on the phone at 12 midnight.",3 years,Bobopod Tanah Abang Jakarta,"overall tempatnya bagus dan strategis banget. posisinya di perempatan cideng, kalo mau mencari makan juga gampang karena di seberang jalan ada kfc jalan dikit ketemu mcd, bk, sama domino. kalo mau ngopi juga gampang banget karena posisinya sebelahan sama starbuck dan ada chatime juga. untuk ukuran hotel kapsul kamarnya nyaman juga, acnya dingin, toiletriesnya lengkap, ada screen buat muter musik alam dan mengatur warna lampu kamarnya. sedikit bermasalah sama wc nya karena berbau kurang enak kayak comberan begitu dan sempat ada tragedi di malam pertama ke kunci di toilet karena pengait kuncinya kendor dan enggak bisa kebuka kuncinya. untungnya bisa chat langsung petugasnya pakai app jadi cepat ditanganin masalahnya. sama mungkin saran buat nambahin peredam suara di tiap kamarnya, karena waktu malam ke 2 sedikit keganggu sama pengunjung lain yang masih telponan di jam 12 malam."

The location is right next to Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, so this is the noisiest bobopod because the sound of vehicles enters inside.

Laura,4.0,"great experience! 👍🏻 really suitable for a simple stay for one night here 😅 the location is very strategic, near Sudirman Station, MRT, GI, Alfa/Indonesia, Famima, basically access to everywhere is really good. the room is in the form of a capsule, coincidentally my mom and I got the top bed. for short people like me, this is a bit high, the distance between the bed and the floor below 😅 so it's like jumping if you want to go down, in fact at that time we heard a sound like someone fell from the top bed. maybe it's too high for them too (?) the room is very clean, the lights and tablet to adjust the room's atmosphere all work well. the bathroom is also clean. for breakfast it's just ordinary, only get cereal and milk. oh yeah, this place is really tucked away next to Indomaret. access to enter this place is a bit shabby and dirty as soon as the entrance (below). maybe it can be paid more attention to in the future",2 months,Bobopod Thamrin Jakarta,"great experience! 👍🏻 cocok banget buat nginep yang simple sat-set satu malam di sini 😅 lokasinya strategis banget, dekat stasiun sudirman, mrt, gi, alfa/indonesia, famima, pokoknya akses ke mana-mana oke banget lah.  kamarnya berbentuk kapsul begitu, kebetulan aku sama mama aku dapat kasur yang di atas. buat orang pendek kayak aku, ini agak ketinggian ya jarak kasur sama lantai bawahnya 😅 jadi kayak loncat begitu kalau mau turun, malah kami waktu itu sampai dengar suara kayak orang jatuh dari kasur atas. mungkin terlalu tinggi kali ya buat mereka juga (?)  kamarnya bersih banget, lampu sama tablet buat mengatur nuansa kamarnya semua berfungsi dengan baik. kamar mandinya juga bersih. untuk breakfast-nya biasa saja sih, cuma dapat sereal sama susu.  oh ya, ini tempatnya nyempil banget di samping indomaret. akses buat masuk ke tempat ini agak lusuh kotor begitu pintu masuknya (di bawah). mungkin bisa lebih diperhatiin lagi ya ke depannya"
