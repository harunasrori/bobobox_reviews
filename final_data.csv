(tidak sebanding) alhasil harus ganti pakai uang pribadi aduh  dari maret sampai agustus belum ada kejelasan dari pihak bobocabin⭐️",the accountability is not fast enough slow‼ be careful who want to go there by vehicle because parking in the forest area bobocabin if a branch or tree branch fall which cause our car to be damaged is not bobocabins responsibility the officer there also admitted that the tree there were old and it wa very natural for an incident like this so at most they were given a breakfast complaint not comparable a a result i had to replace it with my own money oh from march to august there ha been no clarity from bobocabin

perjalanan ke lokasi menggunakan kereta turun di sta. purwokerto selanjutnya menggunakan gocar - nomer cabin its given by system jadi enggak bisa pilih2 - untuk chek ini perlu download bobobox apps - disarankan kalian bisa bawa plastik sampah sendiri untuk bisa dibuang ke tempat  sampah. please banget jangan tinggalkan sampah ditempah seindah ini. - pegawai disini enggak banyak dan untuk melayani area seluas ini perlu kesabaran, kalian bisa lebih mandiri kalau ada ammenities kurang atau hal yang lain, bisa chat dulu kemudian ambil di lobby. - tempat ini sudah aman dari hewan2 yang berbahaya (melata, dsb) yang kami jumpai tupai monyet - waktu terbaik untuk dinikmati saat kabutnya turun sore dan subuh - kalau minat kesini pls switch your mode into relax mode spaya lebih bisa menikmati alam disini - stay lebih dari 1 malam sangat disarankan - bawa lotion anti nyamuk ya  kelebihan - sepi jauh dari hiruk pikuk asri banget - desain cabin futuristik hi tech (no tv) - bersih - size bed 160-180 an 2 bantal 1 selimut - toileteries lengkap kalo kurang handuk / mop bisa req - wifi cepat dan bagus - untuk makan bisa dari rsto rekanan cabin order via apps bobobox hampir semua rasanya enak harganya masih wajar mesti sabar ya karena nunggunya 1 jam. jadi kalo mau makan jam 18an ya order makan 1 jam sebelumnya - opsi lain order bisa via enggak*ab / enggak*food - pegawai ramah dan helpfull -  kekurangan - tidak tersedia akses untuk disabilitas - beberapa lampu akses jalan di area cabin banyak yang mati  masukan untuk bobocabin - mungkin bisa ada rekanan agar bisa menyediakan transportasi dari dan ke lokasi dengan biaya tertentu - apabila ada shuttle untuk ke lokasi wisata lainnya bisa memudahkan - disediakan persewaan sepeda / motor listrik / yang lain agar bisa explore area sekitar - perlu di tambah penguat sinyal agar saat wifi mati masih bisa menggunakan sinyal provider - perlu diberi himbauan agar tamu bertanggung jawab thd sampah dan putung rokoknya, banyak menemukan putungbrokok, tutup botol, plastik minuman instan berserakan di area cabin - tempat sampah di luar cabin - agar lebih edukatif mungkin pohonnya bisa dikasih tag nama dan penjelasannya apa -  buat kami yang berasal dari kota besar lokasinya dan vibesnya 5* sangat direkomendasikan untuk stay disini.  semoga dengan adanya bobocabin lingkungan tetap asri tidak mengganggu ekosistem",ubelieveble place to stay bobocabin baturaden this place just opened about 34 month ago we booked through agdi for the deluxe cabin room type for 3 day 2 night travel to the location by train get off at station purwokerto then use gocar cabin number is given by the system so you cant choose to check this you need to download the bobobox apps it is recommended that you bring your own trash bag to be thrown in the trash please dont leave trash in a place a beautiful a this there are not many employee here and to serve an area this large it take patience you can be more independent if there are missing amenity or other thing you can chat first then pick it up in the lobby this place is safe from dangerous animal crawler etc that we encountered were squirrel monkey the best time to enjoy it is when the fog descends in the afternoon and dawn if you are interested in coming here please switch your mode into relax mode so that you can enjoy nature here more staying more than 1 night is highly recommended bring mosquito repellent lotion yes the advantage quiet far from the hustle and bustle very beautiful futuristic hitech cabin design no tv clean bed size 160180 2 pillow 1 blanket complete toiletry if you dont have enough towel mop you can request fast and good wifi for food you can order from partner cabin restaurant via the bobobox app almost everything taste good the price is still reasonable you have to be patient because you have to wait 1 hour so if you want to eat at 6 pm order your meal 1 hour before another option is to order via gakab gakfood friendly and helpful staff shortcoming no access for disabled people some of the access light in the cabin area are out input for bobocabin maybe there could be a partner to provide transportation to and from the location at a certain cost if there is a shuttle to other tourist location it could be easier bicycle electric motorbike other rental are provided so that you can explore the surrounding area need to add a signal booster so that when the wifi is off you can still use the provider signal need to be given an appeal for guest to be responsible for their trash and cigarette butt many found cigarette butt bottle cap instant drink plastic scattered in the cabin area trash can outside the cabin to be more educational maybe the tree could be given name tag and explanation for u who come from big city the location and vibe are 5 highly recommended to stay here hopefully with the presence of bobocabin the environment remains beautiful without disturbing the ecosystem

DENKA,4.0,2024-05-13 00:00:00,12,295,tidak menginap di bobo cabin. tapi di green grass nya. minus nya kok sekarang banyak banget lalat ya? lihat di kendaraan banyak yang di hinggapi lalat. untuk dingin nya sudah dpat 18c di malam hari.  nyamann,didnt stay at bobo cabin but at green grass the downside is why are there so many fly now look at the vehicle lot of fly are perching on them for the cold it can get to 18c at night comfortable

Yulius,4.0,2024-04-13 00:00:00,12,297,"lokasinya bagus tapi harus berhati-hati dengan tangga ada batu krikil yang bisa licin ketika turun, service cukup cepat, untuk kamar ini cukup mengecewakan karena kebersihannya tidak dijaga, dari jendela hingga sudut kamar yang sangat kotor, didepan halaman juga banyak bekas-bekas sampah, yang seharusnya bisa dibersihkan dan kalau bisa berikan tanda untuk jangan buang sembarangan didepan kamar",the location is good but you have to be careful with the stair there are gravel stone which can be slippery when going down the service is quite fast this room is quite disappointing because the cleanliness is not maintained from the window to the corner of the room it is very dirty in front of the yard there are also lot of trace of rubbish which should be cleaned and if possible give a sign not to throw it carelessly in front of the room
Kristina Tambunan,2.0,2024-04-13 00:00:00,12,298,jujur ini tempatnya bagus secara lokasi tapi bukan cabinnya. didalam kabin atau kamar gue nemui lalat dan ruangan bau apek. apakah sebelum guest cabin masuk enggak di cek dulu? kecewa gue enggak rekomendasi kalau qualitas cabin kurang memuaskan. sarapan pagi gue sangat kecewa karena soto yang disajikan basi. apa enggak ada pengecekan sama sekali? masa tqmu dikasi makan soto basi. gue enggak rekomendasikan buat teman-teman yang mau kesini. sebelum qualitas diperbaiki,to be honest this place is good in term of location but not the cabin in the cabin or room i found fly and the room smelled musty is it checked before entering the guest cabin im disappointed that i dont recommend if the quality of the cabin is le than satisfactory my breakfast wa very disappointed because the soto served wa stale is there no checking at all time tqmu wa told to eat stale soup i do not recommend it to friend who want to come here before the quality is improved

Arya Bima,4.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,12,444,"sebenarnya tempatnya bagus banget, tapi yang aku enggak paham apa memang rumputnya dibiarkan panjang panjang begitu untuk mempertahankan kesan hutan ya? dan untuk harga 1.3 juta permalam, fasilitasnya minim sekali, kami waktu kesana memang sedang kondisi hujan sih malamnya jadi yang awalnya mau ada acara bbq malamnya jadi enggak jadi karena payung yang disediakan kecil jadinya enggak bisa buat neduh ramean, mungkin bisa diperbesar lagi atap balconynya, dan saya menginap di pod 30 yang kamar mandi dalam, tidak bisa menyambung bluetoothnya dengan handphone jadi untuk harga segitu overpriced sih dengan fasilitas yang ada",actually the place is really nice but what i dont understand is whether the grass is left so long to maintain the impression of a forest right and for the price of 13 million per night the facility are very minimal when we went there it wa actually raining that night so initially we wanted to have a bbq event that night so it didnt happen because the umbrella provided were small so they couldnt provide shade for the crowd maybe the balcony roof could be enlarged further and i stayed in pod 30 which had an en suite bathroom couldnt connect bluetooth with a cellphone so for that price it wa overpriced considering the existing facility

Armanto Prasetyo,5.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,12,499,"review bobocabin cikole ini sudah lama sebenarnya, hampir 4 bulan lalu.  konsep nginep di alam bebas yang cukup unik, buat yang enggak mau ribet buka tenda dan sebagainya.  kontur tanahnya yang naik turun lumayan juga buat olahraga kecil kecilan, mengusir hawa dingin. saran kalo kesini bawanya tas backpack saja, jangan koper. tempo hari sempat lihat yang bawa koper kok ribet geret geretnya. ya namanya juga camping, angkat angkat dikit enggak apa-apa.  kabin family nya terbatas, jadi mesti booking jauh jauh hari kalau mau nginap ramean serumah. kalo kabin yang standar sih banyak, enggak usah kuatir keabisan. kecuali pas musim liburan kali ya.  untuk makanan enggak usah khawatir, kalo mau bisa pesan via ojol juga diantar sampai depan pintu. asal jangan meminta abangnya buru buru ya, lokasi jauh soalnya.  tapi menurut saya better bawa sendiri bahan bahan makanan dari rumah, bawa kompor gas portable lalu bakar bakaran. lebih terasa hawa camping nya.  kebersihan cabin cukup terawat, ada semut dan binatang kecil dikit berkeliaran wajar lah, namanya juga di hutan.",this cikole bobocabin review is actually a long time ago almost 4 month ago the concept of staying in the wild is quite unique for those who dont want the hassle of opening a tent and so on the contour of the land that go up and down is also good for small sport expelling the cold i suggest that you bring a backpack only not a suitcase at the end of the day i had time to see who wa carrying the suitcase why wa it so complicated yes it also called camping lift lift a little it okay the family cabin are limited so you must book well in advance if you want to stay with the same family if there are many standard cabin dont worry about running out except for the holiday season pas for food dont worry if you want you can order via ojol and it will be delivered to your door a long a you dont ask his brother to hurry the location is far away but in my opinion it better to bring your own food ingredient from home bring a portable gas stove and burn it it feel more like camping the cleanliness of the cabin is well maintained there are ant and small animal roaming around it normal it also called the forest

Dewi Aprilliani,3.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,12,548,"first of all pengalaman selama stay di bobocabin cikole selama 1 malam sofar benar-benar healing dari setress nya pekerjaan di jakarta. oke banget untuk liburan sejenak disini pengalaman tidur di hutan pinus dengan dingin kapasitas 19 derajat di malam hari situasi hujan nya lembang jadi harus bawa baju dingin dan juga kaos kaki tebal sangat dianjurkan.  cuma agak bingung pas mau cek ini harus bagaimana nya, karena enggak ada sign ataupun petunjuk harus kemana nya yang ada hanya security dari perhutani saja yang info kalo mau cek ini ternyata dari tempat pertama mobil masuk harus ambil kanan terus naik. kalo yang pertama kali terus langsung drop mobil terus naik itu akan sangat jauh untuk proses cek ini  to the point saja ya : *minus* = - no info detail for cek ini ( terlalu jauh naik untuk cek ini) harusnya mereka buat cek ini counter di bawah dan harus nya ada orang bobocabin yang stand by di bawah supaya tamu enggak bingung, dan cek ini melalui aplikasi sendiri dan harus registrasi dll yang bikin wasting time banget. lalu fungsi nya sih reception apa kalau begitu (which is tamu cek ini dari aplikasi) chat pun balas nya lama  - orang-orang bobocabin terlalu cuek terutama di counter cek ini ( proses cek ini- cek out dari aplikasi) juga enggak diinfo detail walaupun ada fitur chat di aplikasi bobocabin nya.  - kamar nya lembab, bed dan linen bau (cuma di awal cek ini masih wangi, tapi pas malam mau tidur berasa banget bau lembab seperti linen enggak kering tapi tetap digunakan)  - mereka ada paket untuk bbq dan suki dengan harga yang terlalu mahal, kebetulan saya ambil paket suki dengan harga 105 rbu net yang di dapat bakso suki2 an ukuran 250 gr dan awalnya cuma dikasi bumbu kaldu ayam tok, saya tanya apakah ada lain nya dibawah ada tomyam yudh saya meminta 2 dan dikasi tapi bumbu nya kurang cocok di saya. dengan harga segitu paling enggak ada jamur, sayur ataupun itu (menurut saya no worth it to buy) kalo beli yang paket ayam hanya dapat dada ayam bonless plus air panas only (better bawa sendiri saja)  - petugas counter pada saat cek out enggak ramah (no hospitality industry) seperti nya pihak bobocabin harus selalu adakan training how to handle guest cek ini - cek out (intinya enggak diinfo di awal details cek ini sampai cek out )  - kamar mandi (kebetulan saya pesan yang kamar mandi luar) agak jember banget ya harusnya ada cleaner orang house keping stand by disana karena becek banget dan bekas tamu2 lain mandi hampir kepleset pas mau mandi tapi untung saya pakai sendal karet  - enggak di prepare sendal seperti hotel (better bawa sendiri )  - pintu agak keras setelah scan barcode ( harus benar-benar di dorong keras baru bisa)  - positif =  - ada fitur canggih untuk blur jendela di ipad mereka, dan ada fitur menggantikan warna lampu tidur cukup menarik  - glamping area hutan pinus dengan udara sejuk banget  - banyak spot foto-foto di dekat kamar and di hutan2 sana  - cocok  untuk kalian yang suka naik2 gunung  - udara sejuk banget, dapat energi positif vibes pas pagi, keren lah tempat nya  semoga dengan adanya beberapa komentar dari saya ataupun dari tamu lain nya, bisa jadi masukan untuk bobocabin supaya kedepan nya semakin baik. bukan untuk menjatuhkan bobocabin ya adanya masukan adalah untuk memperbaiki dari segi kenyamanan tamu2 selanjut nya.  thx bobocabin :)  warmest gteeting",first of all the experience during staying at bobocabin cikole for 1 night sofar really healing from the stress of work in jakarta really good for a short vacation here the experience of sleeping in a pine forest with a cold capacity of 19 degree at night the rainy situation of lembang so you have to bring cold clothes and also thick sock is highly recommended just a bit confused when i want to check this how to do it because there is no sign or instruction where to go there is only security from perhutani who informs that if you want to check this it turn out that from the first place the car enters you have to turn right and then go up if the first time then immediately drop the car and go up it will be very far for the check process to the point yes minus no detailed info for check this too far up to check this they should have made a check this counter below and there should be a bobocabin person on standby below so that guest are not confused and check this through their own application and have to register etc which make a lot of time wasting then what is the function of reception then which is the guest checking this from the application the chat also take a long time to reply the bobocabin people are too indifferent especially at this check counter this check out process check out from the application and they dont provide detailed information even though there is a chat feature in the bobocabin application the room wa damp the bed and linen smelled only at the beginning of the check it still smelled good but when i went to bed at night it smelled really damp like the linen wasnt dry but still used they had package for bbq and suki at price that were too expensive i happened to take the suki package for 105 thousand net and i got 250 gr suki meatball and at first they only had chicken broth seasoning i asked if there wa anything else below there wa tomyam yudh i asked for 2 and given but the spice dont suit me with that price at least there are mushroom vegetable or that in my opinion not worth it to buy if you buy the chicken package you only get bonless chicken breast plus hot water only better bring your own the counter staff at check out is not friendly no hospitality industry it seems like bobocabin should always provide training on how to handle guest check this check out the point is not informed at the beginning of the detail of check this until check out the bathroom i happened to book an outside bathroom is a bit too dirty there should be a house cleaner on standby there because it really muddy and other guest have taken a shower almost slipped when i wanted to take a shower but luckily i wa wearing rubber sandal sandal are not prepared like hotel better bring your own the door is a bit hard after scanning the barcode you have to push it really hard to be able to positive there is a sophisticated feature to blur the window on their ipad and there is a feature to change the color of the bedside lamp which is quite interesting glamping in a pine forest area with very cool air lot of photo spot near the room and in the forest there suitable for those of you who like mountain climbing the air is very cool get positive energy vibe in the morning the place is cool hopefully with some comment from me or other guest it can be input for bobocabin so that in the future it will be better not to bring down bobocabin yes the input is to improve in term of comfort for the next guest thx bobocabin warmest gteeting

malang, tepatnya di area wisata coban rondo, terdapat penginapan yang unik untuk dicoba. dan hari itu kami berkesempatan untuk menginap meskipun cuma semalam di sini.  meski baru berusia dua tahun, tempat penginapan ini hampir selalu fully-booked terutama di setiap akhir pekan, apalagi di musim liburan. jika rencana sudah pasti, maka memesannya jauh-jauh hari perlu untuk dilakukan, apalagi jika sedang ada diskon atau promo di sana.  karena berada di lokasi obyek wisata, maka bagi calon penginap akan diterapkan hal yang sama dengan pengunjung wisata lainnya yaitu dengan membeli tiket masuk sekitar rp. 40.000 per orang serta biaya parkir kendaraan.  dari gerbang obyek wisata, untuk menuju penginapan kira-kira butuh sekitar 15 menit perjalanan dengan kendaraan sambil melewati jalanan yang berkelok, naik-turun dengan panorama pepohonan di kiri kanannya. meski jalanan akses ke lokasi cukup baik, kewaspadaan tetap perlu diberikan karena jurang yang curam ada di salah satu sisi jalan.  terdapat area parkir yang tidak terlalu luas di sekitaran lobby. namun itu hanya boleh digunakan untuk menurunkan dan menaikkan saja. dan ini mungkin merupakan hal yang kurang nyaman dari penginapan ini. setelah melakukan drop-off, kendaraan harus turun kembali ke bawah untuk parkir di lokasi wisata. memang akan ada petugas hotek yang melakukan penjemputan, namun tetap saja akan menjadi hambatan terutama untuk mereka yang akan jalan-jalan keluar lokasi penginapan.  kesan pertama begitu sampai di lokasi adalah suasana yang sejuk, bersih, rapi dan tertata. bangunan kabin tertata dengan baik dengan jarak yang ideal antara satu dengan lainnya. akses jalannya berlapis beton dan mengikuti kontur tanah, sehingga terkadang naik dan terkadang turun.  proses check-ini cukup mudah dan cepat. qr khusus akan diberikan melalui gue/a sebagai akses untuk masuk ke kamar. karena tidak ada kunci lagi, jadi ada baiknya qr akses di-share dengan anggota keluarga yang ikut serta.  ada dua tipe kabin yang tersedia. tipe kabin untuk berempat dan berdua.  masuk ke dalam kabin, ternyata ukurannya tak sebesar seperti tampak luarnya. tentu saja karena terdapat kamar mandi di dalamnya. sehingga kabin benar-benar compact dan menyisakan sedikit space untuk menggelar sajadah.  selain pencahayaannya bisa diatur warna dan intensitasnya, kamar di kabinnya terdapat kaca yang cukup besar untuk memandang area di bawahnya. dan kebetulan view dari kamar kami langsung menghadap ke lembah di mana area songgoriti ada di sana. karena berjenis smart / switch glass, maka kaca tersebut dapat diatur tingkat keburaman maupun kebeningannya sesuai kebutuhan.  kamar mandi tersedia dengan ukuran yang agak kecil, namun cukuplah untuk mandi. dan yang penting, tersedia heater sehingga bisa mandi dengan menggunakan air hangat. handuk dan amenities tersedia di kamar mandi. sementara itu pemanas air untuk membuat kopi tersedia di dekat tempat tidurnya. cocoklah untuk membuat minuman panas maupun mie instan.  jaket mesti dibawa dan dikenakan di sini. karena meski baru jam 16.00 sore hari, udara dingin sudah mulai datang. ditambah lagi dengan hembusan udara sore yang lumayan kencang.  namun itu juga merupakan saat yang pas untuk menikmati panorama luar ruanganan yaitu tatkala lampu-lampu mulai menerangi sehingga suasana sore dan petang menjadi semakin keren. begitupun di pagi hari selepas subuh hingga terbitnya matahari.  beberapa fasilitas seperti area communal, titik pandang dan area api unggun tersedia dan bisa dinikmati. namun hanya sampai jam 21.00 saja, karena setelah itu semuanya harus saling menjaga ketenangan dan mengindari keberisikan yang berlebih. begitu aturan di sini.  selain snack dan air mineral, tidaklah tersedia makanan di penginapan ini, kecuali dengan memesannya terlebih dahulu. jadi membawa bekal untuk diolah atau dimasak adalah hal yang sangat penting, terutama untuk makan malam dan sarapan pagi.",vacation while stayingcation in a high altitude and cool air ha become an option for resident or tourist in various place around malang precisely in the coban rondo tourist area there is a unique inn to try and that day we had the opportunity to stay even though it wa only one night here although it is only two year old this inn is almost always fully booked especially on weekend especially during the holiday season if the plan is certain then booking it well in advance is necessary especially if there is a discount or promo there because it is located in a tourist attraction then for prospective inn the same thing will be applied a other tourist visitor namely by buying an entrance ticket of around idr 40000 per person and vehicle parking fee from the gate of the tourist attraction to get to the inn it take about 15 minute by vehicle while passing through winding road going up and down with panoramic view of tree on the left and right although the access road to the location is quite good vigilance still need to be given because there is a steep ravine on one side of the road there is a parking area that is not too large around the lobby but it can only be used for lowering and raising and this may be the le comfortable thing about this inn after doing the dropoff the vehicle must go back down to park at the tourist location indeed there will be a hotel officer who will pick you up but it will still be an obstacle especially for those who will walk out of the inn the first impression when you arrive at the location is a cool clean neat and organized atmosphere the cabin building is well arranged with an ideal distance between one and another the road access is covered in concrete and follows the contour of the land so sometimes it go up and sometimes down the checkin process is quite easy and fast a special qr will be given through mea a access to enter the room because there is no key anymore so it a good idea to share the qr access with family member who are participating there are two type of cabin available cabin type for four and two entering the cabin it turn out that the size is not a big a it look outside of course because there is a bathroom inside so the cabin is really compact and leaf a little space to spread out a prayer mat besides the lighting can be adjusted in color and intensity the room in the cabin ha a glass that is large enough to see the area below and coincidentally the view from our room directly face the valley where the songgoriti area is there because it is a smart switch glass type the glass can be adjusted to the level of opacity or clarity a needed the bathroom is available with a rather small size but it is enough for a shower and importantly a heater is available so you can shower using warm water towel and amenity are available in the bathroom meanwhile a water heater for making coffee is available near the bed suitable for making hot drink or instant noodle jacket must be brought and worn here because even though it is only 1600 in the afternoon the cold air ha started to come coupled with the fairly strong afternoon air gust but that is also the right time to enjoy the outdoor panorama namely when the light start to light up so that the afternoon and evening atmosphere becomes even cooler likewise in the morning after dawn until sunrise several facility such a communal area viewpoint and campfire area are available and can be enjoyed but only until 2100 because after that everyone must maintain peace and avoid excessive noise thats the rule here apart from snack and mineral water there is no food available at this inn unless you order it in advance so bringing provision to be processed or cooked is very important especially for dinner and breakfast

Diana Chandra,5.0,2024-03-14 00:00:00,21,633,"i've always loved forests, mist, and rain, and bobocabin coban rondo is just perfect. when i went there, i instantly fell ini love with it. the vibe is like being ini a magical forest, and it feels like disconnecting from the outside world.  i stayed ini cabin number 9, which is located ini the far corner. unfortunately, for the 2 people cabin, the view is not as good as ini cabins 12 - 26 because it is obstructed by many trees. there is no wooden terrace, so it's directly on the ground with rocks, facing a fence separating it from the forest. unlike other cabins, this is less conducive for relaxing on the terrace, so i decided to cancel my plan to book a bbq.  despite of that experience, i still love the place, and the room inside the cabin is clean, although i'sama bit jealous of people who get cabin with a nice view.  here are a few things to consider if you plan to go there  1. parking is not located ini front of the hotel, so you can only drop off people and luggage at the lobby. for parking, you have to go back out to the main road, and there are hotel staff who will pick you up with a motorcycle.  2. cabin numbers cannot be chosen, they are determined directly by the system, and cabin exchanges are not possible. so, it's a matter of luck.  3. for the 2-person cabins, the best views are from numbers 12 to 26 because there are fewer trees blocking the view and there is a wooden terrace, making it cleaner. executive cabins (for 4 people) don't need to worry about the view and terrace as their location is the most strategic, close to the lobby.  4. cooking utensils are not allowed, there is a shared kitchen with a microwave.  5. bring plenty of food, as it will be difficult to go out again, especially if you don't intend to buy a grill orang suki there. other available food includes instant meals and snacks.  6. there is a bathroom inside the cabin, and hot water is only sufficient for 2 adults (from my experience, if shampooing hair, it's enough for just one person). if it runs out, you'll have to wait for the water heater to heat up the water for 1.5 - 2 hours.  7. bring insect repellent lotion.  8. the best view is at sunrise, don't miss it  9. plus point, the cabin is clean and the bed sheet is fragrant  10. you need to pay an entrance ticket to the coban rondo area of idr 45,0 per person to go to the bobocabin location (price as of 03.02.2024).",ive always loved forest mist and rain and bobocabin coban rondo is just perfect when i went there i instantly fell ini love with it the vibe is like being ini a magical forest and it feel like disconnecting from the outside world i stayed ini cabin number 9 which is located ini the far corner unfortunately for the 2 people cabin the view is not a good a ini cabin 12 26 because it is obstructed by many tree there is no wooden terrace so it directly on the ground with rock facing a fence separating it from the forest unlike other cabin this is le conducive for relaxing on the terrace so i decided to cancel my plan to book a bbq despite of that experience i still love the place and the room inside the cabin is clean although isama bit jealous of people who get cabin with a nice view here are a few thing to consider if you plan to go there 1 parking is not located ini front of the hotel so you can only drop off people and luggage at the lobby for parking you have to go back out to the main road and there are hotel staff who will pick you up with a motorcycle 2 cabin number cannot be chosen they are determined directly by the system and cabin exchange are not possible so it a matter of luck 3 for the 2person cabin the best view are from number 12 to 26 because there are fewer tree blocking the view and there is a wooden terrace making it cleaner executive cabin for 4 people dont need to worry about the view and terrace a their location is the most strategic close to the lobby 4 cooking utensil are not allowed there is a shared kitchen with a microwave 5 bring plenty of food a it will be difficult to go out again especially if you dont intend to buy a grill orang suki there other available food includes instant meal and snack 6 there is a bathroom inside the cabin and hot water is only sufficient for 2 adult from my experience if shampooing hair it enough for just one person if it run out youll have to wait for the water heater to heat up the water for 15 2 hour 7 bring insect repellent lotion 8 the best view is at sunrise dont miss it 9 plus point the cabin is clean and the bed sheet is fragrant 10 you need to pay an entrance ticket to the coban rondo area of idr 450 per person to go to the bobocabin location price a of 03022024

Agatha Liany Hadi,3.0,2023-08-17 00:00:00,21,696,"tempatnya oke, meskipun saya pesan cabin untuk kapasitas 4 orang menurut saya jatuhnya agak sempit (padahal saya datang bertiga jatuhnya agak penuh). didalam ruangan tidak ada tv, tetapi tersedia perlengkapan mandi dan air panas. lebih baik kalau kesini jangan terlalu bawa banyak barang karena bakal penuh banget. makanan tidak direkomendasikan, rasa tidak enak dan penyajiannya lama, banyak menu yang tidak ada juga 🥲 mungkin karena makanan masih pesan lewat warga lokal ya, jadi saran saya lebih baik bawa pop mie atau makan diluar saja 🥹. sangat disayangkan saja sih, padahal pemandangannya bagus banget 😅 hanya service nya saja yang perlu ditingkatkan.",the place is okay although i ordered a cabin for 4 people in my opinion it wa a bit cramped even though i came with three people it wa a bit full there is no tv in the room but toiletry and hot water are available it better if you dont bring too many thing because it will be very crowded the food is not recommended the taste is not good and the serving is slow there are many menu that are not available too maybe because the food is still ordered through local resident so my advice is to bring instant noodle or eat outside it really unfortunate even though the view is really good only the service need to be improved
Willi Tjandra,5.0,2023-08-17 00:00:00,21,697,"kamarnya menarik dan memberikan kesan tersendiri, karena memang temanya cabin jadi memang agak kecil.. karena cukup dingin, sayangnya acnya waktu dicoba diset jadi penghangat enggak bisa.. jadi lebih baik kalo bawa selimut atau celana panjang waktu tidur. bagi yang enggak kuat dingin..  waktu malam harus disediakan tempat bakaran, dan ada kayu bakar yang dijual perikat.. 3 ikat bisa untuk 45 menit - 1 jam  yang aneh waktu menuju ke hotel di stop di gate masuk wisata coban rondo, kena per orang yang di dalam mobil.. menurut saya agak aneh.. harusnya kalo nginep kita sudah include.. tapi untungnya bisa digunakan di pagi harinya untuk masuk ke air terjun.  hati-hati di jalan waktu berkabut di malam hari, kalo lampu putih sinarnya enggak tembus kabut, pakai fog lamp yang kuning. dan akan lebih seru kalo menginap dengan beberapa keluarga sodara ataupun teman, karena anak-anak akan bisa bermain bareng.",the room is interesting and give it own impression because the theme is cabin so it is indeed a bit small because it is quite cold unfortunately the air conditioner when tried to be set to warmer did not work so it is better if you bring a blanket or long pant when sleeping for those who cant stand the cold at night there must be a place for a fire and there is firewood sold per bundle 3 bundle can last for 45 minute 1 hour the strange thing is when going to the hotel we were stopped at the entrance gate of the coban rondo tourist attraction charged per person in the car in my opinion it is a bit strange if we stay overnight it should have been included but fortunately it can be used in the morning to enter the waterfall be careful on the road when it is foggy at night if the white light doe not penetrate the fog use the yellow fog lamp and it will be more fun if you stay with several family or friend because the child will be able to play together

FAKHMA ZAKKI RAMADHANI,5.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,724,"konsepnya memang camping ya. jadi yang berharap dapat fasilitas hotel berbintang jelas akan berbeda. tapi pelayanannya tetap luar biasa jangan diragukan. semuanya sangat bersahabat, mulai dari satpam, resepsionis, hingga helpernya.  untuk anak kecil usia 1 tahun sangat menyenangkan namun harus selalu waspada karena kondisinya naik turun(namanya juga digunung).  bisa pesan bbq sudah termasuk alat panggangnya. kalau membawa alat sendiri sangat disarankan sehingga bisa berhemat. hehe. tinggal memesan kayu bakarnya. ingin dinyalakan atau nyalakan sendiri juga boleh.  sistemnya sebenarnya self service ya. jadi bebas mau mengapai saja. cuma ada jam tenang, jadi setelah jam tenang jangan berisik. saat malam udara dingin sekali, terutama bagi anak-anak jadi jangan lupa membawa jaket.  bagi yang senang camping seperti saya tempat ini benar-benar tempat yang menenangkan dan bisa jadi rekomendasi untuk menghilangkan kepenatan kerja. tentu saya beserta anak dan istri akan kembali lagi.",the concept is indeed camping so those who expect to get star hotel facility will definitely be different but the service is still extraordinary dont doubt it everyone is very friendly from the security guard receptionist to the helper for small child aged 1 year old it is very fun but must always be alert because the condition are up and down it called the mountain you can order a bbq including the grill if you bring your own equipment it is highly recommended so you can save money hehe just order the firewood you can light it or light it yourself the system is actually selfservice so you are free to reach out there is only quiet time so after quiet time dont be noisy at night the air is very cold especially for child so dont forget to bring a jacket for those who like camping like me this place is really a calming place and can be a recommendation to relieve work fatigue of course i my child and wife will come back again

A'innafa Idatun N.S,1.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,760,"dengan harga yang lumayan, rasanya tidk dapat fasilitas dan pelayanan yang memuaskan, agak kecewa sih, bisa dibilang kurang sekali untuk fasilitas dan pelayanannya. pelayanannya kurang ramah, sangat lama, kamar sempit, pesan berbbq 2 jam lebih belum diantar juga, masuk juga harus bayar loket lagi, padal harganya 1,4 mengira sudah termasuk loket ternyata enggak. intinya perlu banyak evaluasi untuk cabin ini. plus nya hanya bagus di view saja, selain itu sangat kurang sekali",with a fairly high price it feel like you dont get satisfactory facility and service a bit disappointed you could say that the facility and service are lacking the service is not very friendly very slow the room is cramped ordering barbecue for more than 2 hour ha not been delivered you also have to pay the counter again to enter even though the price is 14 you thought it included the counter but it didnt the point is there need to be a lot of evaluation for this cabin the only plus is the view apart from that it is very lacking

Nesha Yudanta,4.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,835,"dapat yang viewnya lumayan, cuma mending bawa sendiri alat buat grill sama bahan2nya karena disana cukup pricey sih, aku beli yang 200rb dapat wagyu yang bulat untuk berdua. pengalaman menginap yang seru kalo bisa jangan musim hujan kesananya biar bisa jalan malam nyalain api unggun yang gede juga",got the one with a good view just bring your own tool to make the grill and the ingredient because it quite pricey there i bought the one for 200rb to get a round wagyu for two it an exciting experience to stay there if it not rainy season so you can go for a night walk with a big bonfire too

meeya sabrina,5.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,840,"its a whole great experience,  saya datang jam 3.30 sore, suasana berkabut, sepertinya saat itu lokasi penginapan sedang didalam awan, saya datang bersama anak dan suami saya, dengan memesan family cabin dan ditempatkan di pod 3, paling ujung dan lokasinya berangin dibanding 4 family cabin lainnya, namun saya suka karena privasi terjaga, lokasi penginapan ini sangat indah, sangat memesona, saat berkabut suasananya hangat. family cabin ini dapat ditempati oleh 4 orang dewasa + 2 anak, di dalam kamar disediakan 2 kasur yang sama proper (semua seprei dan selimut wangi, kasur memang tidak terlalu empuk namun tidak keras juga), 4 air mineral merk vit botol 600ml, 4 sikat gigi, 4 handuk, 4 teh + gula, 4 cangkir, untuk amenities tidak selengkap hotel dengan harga yang sama, tapi tentu saja, yang dijual oleh bobocabin adalah experience menginap di pegunungan dengan nyaman, suasananya, sangat sangat tenang, sangat cocok untuk refreshing dari keadaan kantor yang beracun 🤣. di lobi hanya ada 1 meja kecil untuk resepsionis yang juga cuma 1 orang, sehingga saat saya datang dan kebetulan ada 4 kamar lain yang juga mau cekin, jadi harus antri cekin nya (mohon maaf saat cekin resepsionis memang kurang ramah, namun saat saya cekout dan posisi sepi, mbak nya ramah dan tersenyum manis sekali, kalau security nya, juara sih, komunikatif dan ramah). sistem kendali di kamar ini adalah smart cabin, lampu, kunci, dan jendela di penginapan ini dapat diatur melalui aplikasi bobobox yang harus di instal untuk tamu yang akan menginap disini, kunci kamar hanya scan dari qr code, jendela di kamar kami sempat mengalami bug, namun dengan chat di aplikasi, petugas penginapan dapat langsung me restart sistem di kamar. kami beruntung datang di suasana berkabut dan hujan gerimis, sehingga mendapatkan view misty, lalu di jam 3.30 pagi saat kabut hilang, pemandangan kota batu sangat memesona kami. indah sekali.  dari penginapan bisa order bbq + peralatan masaknya, but its quite pricey so i only order for breakfast, sebelum cekin saya sudah membawa makan dari warung dibawah, dan cemilan lengkap untuk anak saya, juga buah2han, susu, mie cup, telor rebus (saya googling katanya di penginapan ini enggak ada restonya), jadi saat di penginapan saya tidak kelaparan hehe. di penginapan ini tersedia dapur umum yang didalamnya ada fasilitas cuci piring serta 2 microwave (bisa manasin nasi, pempek dan rawon dari warung dibawah 🎉) ada penjualan minuman ringan juga, lalu ada buku2 yang bisa dibaca secara gratis dan pilihan bukunya waow, tidak banyak namun berkualitas, saya melihat haenim sutmin, murakami, dan paulo coelho di kabinet didalam dapur 🤭. untuk masuk ke kawasan coban rondo, harus membayar 25k per orang dan 10k untuk kendaraan.  jika ada satu hal yang agak mengecewakan, saya rasa itu adalah menu sarapan american breakfast yang dihargai 115k, kuantitasnya sedikit dan yang kami dapatkan berbeda dengan di menu, katanya akan dapat mashed potatoes, namun yang didapatkan adalah potato wedges, lalu saat pagi, sangat banyak lalat di luar kamar yang sampai merangsek masuk ke dalam kamar, sungguh menjengkelkan.  di sekitar hotel, di dalam kawasan coban rondo, ada banyak kegiatan yang bisa dilakukan untuk keluarga, dan tentu saja sudah dapat tiket untuk masuk ke air terjunnya, overall, dengan harga 745k kami mendapatkan pengalaman yang sangat menyenangkan menginap di family cabin, bobocabin coban rondo.",it a whole great experience i arrived at 330 pm the atmosphere wa foggy it seemed like the location of the inn wa in the cloud i came with my child and husband by booking a family cabin and wa placed in pod 3 the very end and the location wa windy compared to the other 4 family cabin but i like it because privacy is maintained the location of this inn is very beautiful very charming when it foggy the atmosphere is warm this family cabin can be occupied by 4 adult 2 child in the room there are 2 identical proper mattress all sheet and blanket are fragrant the mattress is not too soft but not too hard either 4 bottle of 600ml vit brand mineral water 4 toothbrush 4 towel 4 tea sugar 4 cup for amenity it is not a complete a a hotel with the same price but of course what bobocabin sell is the experience of staying in the mountain comfortably the atmosphere very very quiet very suitable for refreshing from the toxic office condition in the lobby there is only 1 small table for the receptionist who is also only 1 person so when i came and happened to have 4 other room that also wanted to check in so i had to queue to check in i apologize when checking in the receptionist wa not very friendly but when i checked out and the position wa quiet the lady wa friendly and smiled very sweetly a for the security they are champion communicative and friendly the control system in this room is a smart cabin the light lock and window in this inn can be adjusted via the bobobox application which must be installed for guest who will stay here the room key is only scanned from the qr code the window in our room had a bug but by chatting in the application the inn staff can immediately restart the system in the room we were lucky to come in a foggy atmosphere and light rain so we got a misty view then at 330 am when the fog cleared the view of batu city wa very charming for u very beautiful from the inn you can order bbq cooking utensil but it quite pricey so i only order for breakfast before checking in i had brought food from the stall below and complete snack for my child also fruit milk cup noodle boiled egg i googled it said there is no restaurant in this inn so when i wa in the inn i wa not hungry hehe in this inn there is a common kitchen which ha dishwashing facility and 2 microwave can heat rice pempek and rawon from the stall below there are also soft drink for sale then there are book that can be read for free and the choice of book is wow not many but quality i saw haenim sutmin murakami and paulo coelho in the cabinet in the kitchen to enter the coban rondo area you have to pay 25k per person and 10k for vehicle if there is one thing that is a bit disappointing i think it is the american breakfast menu which is priced at 115k the quantity is small and what we got is different from what is on the menu it said that we would get mashed potato but what we got wa potato wedge then in the morning there were so many fly outside the room that even rushed into the room it wa really annoying around the hotel in the coban rondo area there are many activity that can be done for family and of course you can get ticket to enter the waterfall overall for the price of 745k we got a very pleasant experience staying at the family cabin bobo cabin coban rondo
Bella Chandraa,1.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,841,"dapat kamar yang harganya cukup setara sama hotel bintang 4. tapi pelayananya sangat kurang banget, apalagi kalau bawa anak kecil kesini malah tambah ribet. karena pelayananya self service. dan kejadian pada adek aku, suamiku bawa bawaan banyak tapi staff nya enggak ada yang batuin sampai adekku jatuh cuma diketawain saja. karena ini masuk ke coban rondo jadi dimintain tiket lagi per orang 30 ribu. setelah nyampek di lobby barang diturunkan dan parkirnya bukan disitu jadi enggak ada valet, jadi balik lagi buat naruh mobil dibawah dengan jalanan kabut dan pinggir jurang. untuk bawa anak kecil jangan ya karena pasti repot barang bawaan yang banyak, soalnya enggak ada yang bantuin. terus saat beli makan atau snack dibilang enggak ready. nah berhubung laper jadi beli nasi saja dengan harga 40 ribu nasi fiesta sudah tertera di menunya dengan harga 40 ribu malah ditarik 140 dan enggak dikasih bill.  atitudenya kurang, dan tidak ramah sama customer. untuk tempatnya cukup sempit ya jadi kalau mau pup atau pipis pasti baunya sampai tempat tidur, bagus nya karena view pegunungan. tapi kalau hujan juga enggak kelihatan. untuk balik lagi sih kayak nya enggak",got a room that wa quite equivalent to a 4star hotel but the service wa very lacking especially if you bring small child here it would be even more complicated because the service is selfservice and what happened to my little brother my husband brought a lot of luggage but none of the staff helped him until my little brother fell they just laughed at him because this wa entering coban rondo so they asked for another ticket per person for 30 thousand after arriving at the lobby the luggage wa unloaded and the parking lot wa not there so there wa no valet so they went back to park the car below with foggy road and the edge of the cliff dont bring small child because it would be a hassle with a lot of luggage because no one helped then when buying food or snack they said it wasnt ready well because i wa hungry i just bought rice for 40 thousand fiesta rice wa listed on the menu for 40 thousand but they charged 140 and didnt give me a bill the attitude is lacking and not friendly to customer the place is quite narrow so if you want to poop or pee the smell will definitely reach the bed the good thing is because of the mountain view but if it rain you cant see it either i dont think ill come back again
alexis jungen,3.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,842,"cabin minimalis dengan fitur canggih sih.. cuman 1 kabin biasa untuk 2 orang tuh sudah berasa full karena memang ruangannya kecil banget. lokasi jauh dari mana2 jadi ya jangan tll bergantung sama gofood dsb. tapi kita bisa bawa makanan sendiri. mau barbecue sendiri sampai bawa rice cooker sendiri juga boleh. makanan di hotel rada pricey, jadi enggak pesan juga sih",minimalist cabin with sophisticated feature just 1 normal cabin for 2 people already feel full because the room is really small the location is far from anywhere so dont rely on gofood etc but we can bring our own food if you want to have your own barbecue you can also bring your own rice cooker the food at the hotel is a bit pricey so i didnt order it either

(kesalnya itu karena tidak ada pemberitahuan dari pihak bobocabin)  2. selesai check ini, kami meminta bantuan untuk mengantarkan kami ke cabin dan membantu membawa barang (karena saya membawa bayi) otomatis barang banyak. tapi jawaban nya ""self service"" (apa tidak ada empati atau pengecualian kondisi) apalagi kami mendapatkan cabin di ujung dunia ! tapi it's okay, kami mencoba membawa barang sendiri, eh masih 2 langkah barang pun terjatuh karena posisi saya juga lagi gendong bayi, tapi para karyawan dan staff hanya melihat tanpa ada empati menolong :) benar-benar luar biasa.  3. sampai di cabin, teras kotor, kamar kecil, seprai bau apek, karena harus komplen ke depan posisi kami ini capek jadi terpaksa istirahat di seprai bau !  4. mesen makan juga ambil sendiri di dapur.  omaygood 1 juta loh, tapi service nya sangat-sangat kurang.  5. receptionist cewek sangat cuek, tidak ramah!  saran : kalau bisa cari karwayan yang professional pada bidangnya.  keunggulan yang bisa saya rasakan hanya view sunrise nya bagus. lain b saja. cukup sekali saya kesini. tidak rekom deh",enough to stay here once this is what i felt when staying here 1 enter the cobanrondo area pay 30person to go to the waterfall even though our purpose to bobocabin wa not to the waterfall and had reserved a room for 1 million the annoyance wa because there wa no notification from bobocabin 2 after checking in we asked for help to take u to the cabin and help carry our stuff because i wa carrying a baby automatically there were a lot of stuff but the answer wa self service is there no empathy or exception to condition especially since we got a cabin at the end of the world but it okay we tried to carry our own stuff eh after 2 step the stuff fell because my position wa also carrying a baby but the employee and staff just watched without any empathy to help really amazing 3 arrived at the cabin the terrace wa dirty the room wa small the sheet smelled musty because we had to complain to the front our position wa tired so we were forced to rest on the smelly sheet 4 order food also take it yourself in the kitchen omaygood 1 million but the service is very very lacking 5 the female receptionist is very indifferent not friendly suggestion if possible find an employee who is professional in their field the only advantage that i can feel is the beautiful sunrise view other than that it just b ive only been here once i dont recommend it
Mathius Yanuarjo,5.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,854,"konsepnya bukan hotel, lebih ke persewaan kabin di area coban rondo. sistemnya pakai aplikasi, enggak bisa pilih nomor cabin karena random dari aplikasi  pertama datang mobil bisa sampai di depan resepsionis untuk turunkan barang-barang. setelah itu pindah ke parkiran yang jaraknya kurleb 1km. dari parkiran naik mobil komodo balik lagi ke resepsionis. oh iya lebar jalan dari parkiran ke resepsionis pas 1 mobil tapi enggak bakal papasan dengan mobil lain karena ada security yang monitor di resepsionis & parkiran. kalo enggak ketemu security di parkiran langsung telpon saja. ada nomer hp di halte parkiran. takutnya kalo langsung masuk bisa papasan dengan mobil komodo  untuk pelayanan di cabin self service, staff cuma bantu ngisi aplikasi. ada dapur umum untuk cuci piring & oven sendiri. ada kulkas minuman juga tapi enggak tau bayarnya kemana. yang saya lihat staff resepsionis cuma 2 orang & security cuma 2 orang  cabinnya sudah smart cabin, buka pakai barcode dari aplikasi. atur kaca, kunci pintu, lampu bisa pakai aplikasi juga.  saya order family cabin, dapat teh & gula 4 cangkir, handuk 4, water heater 15 liter. mending langsung bawa makanan sendiri karena kalo pesan kayanya lama",the concept is not a hotel more like a cabin rental in the coban rondo area the system us an application you cant choose a cabin number because it random from the first application the car arrives in front of the reception to drop off the good after that move to the parking lot which is about 1km away from the parking lot take a komodo car back to the reception oh yeah the width of the road from the parking lot to the receptionist is just right for 1 car but you wont meet another car because there is security who monitor the reception and parking lot if you dont meet security in the parking lot just call them there is a cellphone number at the parking stop im afraid if you go straight in you might meet a komodo car for service in the selfservice cabin the staff only help fill out the application there is a public kitchen for washing dish and oven yourself there is also a drink refrigerator but i dont know where to pay what i saw wa only 2 reception staff only 2 security people the cabin is a smart cabin open using a barcode from the application adjust the glass door lock light can also use the application i ordered a family cabin got 4 cup of tea sugar 4 towel 15 liter water heater it better to bring your own food because if you order it it will take a long time

PingAn Chen,4.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,866,"1. posisinya masuk di dalam area coban rondo labyrinth , waterfall dll  jadi ketika masuk gerbang info, akan bermalam di bobocabin dan dikenakan biaya 25k/orang dan 10k/mobil. dapat digunakan untuk masuk ke labyrinth dan waterfall.  2. biasanya ketika cek ini mobil akan diarahkan memasuki area hotel, ( max 3 mobil di area cek ini), kemudian mobil diantarkan kembali ke parkir hotel. lalu penginap akan dijemput menggunakan mobil komodo ( max 3 penumpang : 1 didepan, 2 di belakang ) untuk kembali ke area hotel.  jarak antara area parkir dan area hotel sekitar 500m-1km melalui jalan sempit berpaving disebelah jurang.  3. untuk masuk kamar bisa menggunakan aplikasi bobobox dan buka pintu kamar melalui qr code  pas : hanya bisa menggunakan 1 id per kamar  jadi apabila membutuhkan kunci tambahan tinggal mengirimkan foto qr code ke hp keluarga lain.  4. **tidak ada bellboy ataupun staff hotel untuk membawakan barang bawaan ke cabin. anda dapat membawa sendiri barang bawaan menuju ke kamar cabin melalui jalan yang sedikit menanjak.**  5. untuk cabin yang berada di atas beberapa belum jadi, dan tidak memiliki wooden deck dan hanya beralaskan batu. sedangkan yang berada di bawah rata rata sudah memiliki wooden deck. sedangkan cabin lain  6. fire communal ( api unggun sekitar 35k) tetapi saat ini belum tersedia 7. boleh membawa kompor portable dan bahan makanan sendiri, tetapi juga disediakan persewaan kompor dan bahan makanan frozen.  8. didalam kamar terdapat smart tint pdlc yang bisa dirubah dari blur menjadi clear ( seperti di kamar mandi di jepang ). dan juga smart lamp yang dapat berubah warna dan 2 pilihan musik menenangkan yang dapat diakses melalui panel di dalam kamar.  9. water heater kapasitas 15l ( 2 orang ) dan apabila habis membutuhkan waktu 2 jam untuk memanaskan ulang. pas : seharusnya tidak habis apabila digunakan secara normal, tetapi ukuran kamar mandi lumayan sempit.  10. jam tenang jam 9-jam 7 pagi.  dan karena sinar matahari pagi masih bisa menembus jendela yang di blur, kemungkinan kita akan terbangun sekitar jam 5 pagi.  11. terkadang di area hotel akan tertutup kabut yang sangat tebal, sehingga akan agak menyulitkan ketika hendak memasak di luar ruangan.  overall : pemandangan bagus, staff kurang memadai, semoga dikemudian hari ada tambahan staff bellboy kecepatan internet cukup memadai ( sekitar 5mbps upload dan download ).  ataupun jadwal rutin penjemputan dari area parkir ( apabila ada pengunjung yang hendak keluar membeli makanan dsb, tidak ada petugas yang mengantar kembali ke area hotel ).",1 the position is in the coban rondo labyrinth area waterfall etc so when you enter the info gate you will spend the night in bobocabin and be charged 25kperson and 10kcar can be used to enter the labyrinth and waterfall 2 usually when checking in the car will be directed to enter the hotel area max 3 car in this checkin area then the car will be returned to the hotel parking lot then the guest will be picked up using a komodo car max 3 passenger 1 in front 2 behind to return to the hotel area the distance between the parking area and the hotel area is about 500m1km through a narrow paved road next to the ravine 3 to enter the room you can use the bobobox application and open the room door via the qr code pa can only use 1 id per room so if you need an additional key just send a photo of the qr code to another family cellphone 4 there are no bellboy or hotel staff to carry luggage to the cabin you can bring your own luggage to the cabin room via a slightly uphill path 5 for the cabin above some are not finished yet and do not have wooden deck and are only made of stone while those below on average already have wooden deck while other cabin 6 fire communal bonfire around 35k but currently not available 7 may bring your own portable stove and food ingredient but stove rental and frozen food ingredient are also provided 8 in the room there is a smart tint pdlc that can be changed from blur to clear like in bathroom in japan and also a smart lamp that can change color and 2 choice of soothing music that can be accessed via the panel in the room 9 water heater capacity 15l 2 people and if it run out it take 2 hour to reheat fitting it should not run out if used normally but the size of the bathroom is quite narrow 10 quiet hour from 97 am and because the morning sunlight can still penetrate the blurred window we will likely wake up around 5 am 11 sometimes the hotel area will be covered in very thick fog making it a bit difficult when cooking outdoors overall nice view inadequate staff hopefully in the future there will be additional bellboy staff internet speed is quite adequate around 5mbps upload and download or a regular pickup schedule from the parking area if there are visitor who want to go out to buy food etc there are no officer to take them back to the hotel area

Hy Ua,3.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,875,"jujur saja, plusnya tempat ini cuma lokasinya. di gunung, adem, kalau pagi bagus pemandangannya. memang kesannya jual experience saja sih  sekarang gue list minusnya: 1. yang paling utama, jalan dari parkiran ke lokasi resepsionisnya sempit banget kalau mobilnya bukan mobil kecil. ada fasilitas shuttle tapi cuma sampai jam6 sore. jadi kalau di atas jam itu sudah enggak bisa ke kota lagi. kalau mau ke mobil entar diantar satpam pakai motor 2. jangan kesini pas musim hujan, enggak akan bisa bbq dan api unggun. kalau pas enggak bawa makan, harus pesan makanan disini. btw makanan disini ini pesannya juga di warung2 dekat situ. jadi expect slow delivery and average quality 3. sprei dan sarung bantal kayak enggak diganti. masih ada kotoran (rambut, remah makanan, etc) di kasur 4. kamar mandi enggak ada ventilasi dan agak sempit. buat orang yang badannya gede agak susah  overall sih menurutku cukup sekali saja kesini. plusnya enggak sebanding dengan minusnya. harga hampir sama, mending ke aston atau amartha hills saja",to be honest the plus point of this place is just the location in the mountain cool in the morning the view is good it really the effect of selling the experience now i list the minus 1 the most important the road from the parking lot to the reception location is very narrow if the car is not a small car there is a shuttle facility but only until 6pm so if it over that hour you cant go to the city anymore if you want to go to the car be escorted by the security guard use a motorcycle 2 dont come here during the rainy season you wont be able to have a bbq and bonfire if you dont bring food you have to order food here btw the food here is also ordered from nearby stall so expect slow delivery and average quality 3 bed sheet and pillowcase are not replaced there is still dirt hair food crumb etc on the mattress 4 the bathroom ha no ventilation and is quite narrow for people with big body overall are a bit difficult i think it enough to go here once the plus are not comparable to the minus the price is almost the same just go to aston or amartha hill

Mena Setyaji,1.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,892,"dari sejak promo grand opening langsung booking. dapat hrg promonya via aplikasi yang ternyata tetap lebih murah harganya di online booking hotel. terus deh ditunggu2 sebulanan, berangkat senang mau healing di cabin with view eh sampai tempat dapat cabin yang no view. berikut ini beberapa pengalaman yang tidak menyenangkan yang saya rasakan tentang bobocabin coban rondo :  1. resepsionis mbak-mbak yang rambutnya pendek kurang ramah. kayak males2an terima tamu. beberapa kali nginep di penginapan baru kali ini enggak ada sambutan yang ramah. apalagi pas lagi komplain meminta tukar kamar, cuma dijawab “enggak bisa tukar kamar bu jadi memang enggak ada solusi”.  2. cabinnya random by sistem jadi enggak bisa request room apalagi meminta tuker. apesnya lagi pas itu saya dapat cabin tanpa view. jadi buat kalian yang mau rencana nginep disini jangan berekspektasi tinggi gara-gara lihat sosmed ya. waktu itu saya juga sempat menonton ig live nya. stafnya kasih info katanya semua cabin dapat view, tapi kenyataannya enggak dong. sumpah kesel banget pas sampai sana. harga segitu yang dijual view tapi enggak dapat viewnya. tipe deluxe yang enggak dapat view itu 1,2,4,6 dan 8. cuma apes2nya kalo dapat diantara cabin tersebut, yang paling mending diantara cabin no view itu ya cabin 1 karena masih dapat view hutan pinus dan enggak pas orang-orang lewat jadi masih enak kalo pengin nyantai sambil menikmati smart windownya. paling aman tipe family karena cabinnya dapat view lereng semua.  3. pas lagi ngomel2 ke resepsionis dan kesel eh disela dong sama satpam yang badannya kurus masih muda untuk pindahin mobil ke parkiran. balik saya omelin saja. orang lagi kesel enggak ditenangin malah disela.  4. enggak ada ventilasi di toiletnya jadi kalo toilet dibuka otomatis bau deh seisi cabin.  5. sprei dan selimut baunya apek kayak laundryan murah.  6. wifi cepat tapi enggak stabil. sering putus2 apalagi di malam hari.  7. complimentarynya cuma dapat 2 botol air mineral saja tanpa ada gula, teh atau kopi. dan tentunya harga cabin segitu enggak dapat breakfast.  8. pas check ini dibantuin bawa barang tapi cuma sekali bawa, sisanya dibawa tamunya sendiri. waktu check out sama sekali enggak ada yang bantuin bawa barang.  pengalaman pertama mencoba bobocabin langsung dapat hal yang tidak menyenangkan. cukup sekali dan enggak mau kesana lagi 😤",since the grand opening promo i immediately booked i got the promo price via the application which turned out to be cheaper than the price in online hotel booking then i waited for a month i wa happy to heal in a cabin with a view but when i arrived at the place i got a cabin with no view here are some unpleasant experience that i had about bobo cabin coban rondo 1 the receptionist the shorthaired lady wa not very friendly she seemed lazy to receive guest i have stayed at several inn for several time but this time there wa no friendly welcome moreover when i complained and asked to change room i wa only answered i cant change room maam so there really is no solution 2 the cabin are random by the system so i cant request a room let alone ask for an exchange whats even worse is that i got a cabin without a view so for those of you who plan to stay here dont have high expectation because you saw social medium at that time i also had time to watch their ig live the staff gave me information that all cabin have a view but in reality they dont i swear i wa really annoyed when i got there the price wa sold for a view but i didnt get the view deluxe type without view is 1246 and 8 it just unlucky if you get one of those cabin the best among the cabin without view is cabin 1 because it still ha a view of the pine forest and not when people are passing by so it still nice if you want to relax while enjoying the smart window the safest type is the family type because the cabin ha a view of the entire slope 3 when i wa complaining to the receptionist and wa annoyed i wa interrupted by a skinny young security guard who wa moving the car to the parking lot i just scolded him back when someone is annoyed they dont calm him down but interrupt him 4 there is no ventilation in the toilet so if the toilet is opened the whole cabin will automatically smell 5 the sheet and blanket smell musty like cheap laundry 6 the wifi is fast but unstable often disconnected especially at night 7 the complimentary only get 2 bottle of mineral water without sugar tea or coffee and of course the price of the cabin doesnt include breakfast 8 when checking in they helped me carry my luggage but only once the rest wa carried by the guest themselves when checking out no one helped me carry my luggage at all my first experience trying bobocabin wa an unpleasant experience i only did it once and i dont want to go there again
Fery Dwi Arizal,3.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,893,tempatnya bagus kamarnya bagus suasanyanya sangat bagus sekali  cuma mungkin buat jalan masuk mungkin bisa di lebarkan sedikit apalagi kalau kendaraan besar di jembatan kecil itu atau mungkin di siapkan shuttle.  dan mungkin buat harga buat menginap lebih seru kalau sudah include dengan tiket masuk.,the place is nice the room is nice the atmosphere is very nice but maybe the entrance road could be widened a little especially for large vehicle on the small bridge or maybe a shuttle could be provided and maybe the price for staying overnight would be more exciting if it wa included with the entrance ticket

Victor Santoso,2.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,910,"tempat parkir belum jadi, semoga ke depan sudah jadi, parkir di dekat wahana coban rondo, bolak balik diantar satpam dan pegawainya, beberapa kali masih terjadi sisipan karena jalur cuma untuk 1 mobil  waktu saya datang untuk check ini kurleb pukul 14 kamar belum siap, ada sisa makanan di teras dikerumuni hornet, sampai sore hornetnya 3 ekor enggak pergi2 mengerumuni kami, diminta bantuan untuk mengusir lama banget datengnya, dengan ditambahi keterangan, semua kamar ada hornetnya, kita sudah survey semua dan tidak ada.  bbq mahal, tidak lengkap, dan ambil sendiri. kamar lain ternyata juga ada yang bawa sendiri juga kompor dan alat masak. tidak ada yang cek ricek area cabin2, enggak bisa bayangkan dapat kamar ujung sendiri.  kamar interior oke, bluetooth speaker rakitan biasa, kualitas audio rendah dan susah connect. kaca2 kurang bersih, desain kasa nyamuk tidak bisa menutup sempurna karena handle jendela. pas kita nginep hujan sepanjang hari, berharap akan ada penambahan kanopi / payung besar untuk di balkon, kalo enggak ya enggak akan bisa keluar kamar tanpa basah  yang paling sedih (bagi saya ya, silakan yang lain menilai sendiri) adalah, ketika hujan dan atap cottage terbuat dari logam, tidak ada peredam antara logam dan kayu penutup interiornya. jadi saya terjaga hampir sepanjang malam karena suara hujan yang cukup keras kena atap logam.  jadi menurut saya dengan harga kamar dibandingkan dengan pelayanan dan fasilitas yang didapat saya belum mendapatkan value yang sesuai dengan harapan saya (dan ini saya masih dapat early biru price yang tidak full)",the parking lot is not yet ready hopefully it will be ready in the future parking near the coban rondo ride back and forth accompanied by security guard and employee several time there were still insert because the lane wa only for 1 car when i came to check this at around 14 oclock the room wa not ready there wa the leftover food on the terrace wa surrounded by hornet until the afternoon 3 of the hornet didnt go around and surrounded u we asked for help to chase them away they took a long time to come with the addition of the statement all the room had hornet we surveyed them all and there werent any bbq is expensive not complete and take it yourself in other room it turn out some people also bring their own stove and cooking utensil no one checked the cabin area i couldnt imagine getting my own end room the room interior is okay the bluetooth speaker is ordinary the audio quality is low and difficult to connect the window are not clean the mosquito screen design cannot close completely because of the window handle when we stay in the rain all day hope there will be an additional canopy large umbrella for the balcony if not then you wont be able to leave the room without getting wet the saddest thing for me let others judge for themselves is when it rain and the roof of the cottage made of metal there is no dampening between the metal and the wood of the interior covering so i wa awake almost all night because of the loud sound of rain hitting the metal roof so in my opinion with the price of the room compared to the service and facility i got i didnt get the value that met my expectation and i still got the early blue price which wasnt full

Dave kos,3.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,915,"dibanding bobocabin yang lain di pulau jawa, ini paling oke sih view nya. cuma kalo lu dapat cabin no 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 itu berarti lu lagi apes. kemarin kesana lagi apes saja dengan harga sama tapi dapat cabin yang posisi nya di tengah, bukan di lereng. sudah begitu dilewatin orang-orang pula jadi mau enggak mau jendela selalu di blur. jauh2 kesana mau menikmati view di lereng tapi ternyata zonk. mending harga nya dibedain untuk posisi cabin yang di lereng dan yang di tengah biar customer enggak menyesal sudah expect dapat view lereng ternyata zonk. tapi ya sedikit terobati dengan view malam hari n sunrise nya walopun harus kedinginan lihat dari luar karena enggak bisa lihat dari dalam kamar. security2 nya patut di apresiasi karena mereka-mereka yang anter kita dari lobby ke parkiran dan sebaliknya. pakai motor pribadi pula. jadi minimal kasih tips lah buat mereka. kalo pagi juga suara burung mockingjay nya bagus banget. overall yang paling oke cuma keikhlasan security nya yang rela nganter kita bolak balik",compared to other bobocabins on the island of java this one ha the best view only if you get cabin number 1 2 4 6 8 that mean youre unlucky yesterday i went there again and it wa bad for the same price but i got a cabin in the middle not on the slope there are so many people passing by so like it or not the window are always blurred i went all the way there to enjoy the view on the slope but it turned out to be zoned out it better if the price is differentiated for the cabin position on the slope and the one in the middle so that customer dont regret that they expected to get a view of the slope but it turn out to be zonk but yes it is a little relieved by the view at night and the sunrise even though you have to be cold looking from outside because you cant see it from inside the room the security personnel should be appreciated because they were the one who took u from the lobby to the parking lot and vice versa use a private motorbike too so at least give them tip in the morning the sound of the mockingjay bird is really good overall the best thing wa just the sincerity of the security who wa willing to take u back and forth
Gisela Elshadelin,1.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,916,"hal yang bagus: udara sejuk dan satpam juga ramah, bersedia mengantar tamu dengan sepeda motor karena jarak parkiran dan hotel yang cukup jauh  hal buruk: 1. pemilihan kamar secara random dan tidak adil. saya pesan kamar deluxe, dan ditaruh di tengah yang dimana banyak orang yang lewat (akan saya upload gambarnya). jujur, saya tidak meminta untuk di lereng, namun dengan posisi di tengah itu tidak ada privasi, karena jika jendela di buka, orang lain bisa melihat kita. dan akhirnya saya harus menutup jendela karena risih juga kalau dilihat orang (menurut saya lebih tidak ada privasi yang diberikan oleh pihak hotel)  2. staff yang kurang komunikasi. saya ingin order makanan, namun staff tiba-tiba bilang kalau sudah close order, padahal tidak ada info secara tertulis. bahkan di menu tertulis “pemesanan bisa dilakukan melalui host pukul 07.00-21.00”, dan saya pesan pukul 18.30. bagaimana tamu bisa tau jam close order kalau tidak diinfo secara lisan atau tulisan? 😅  3. kasur yang keras sekali. apa mungkin karena konsepnya di tengah hutan jadi keras?  4. tidak ada staff yang akan membantu barang kalian untuk naik ke cabin. jadi, kalau barangnya banyak akan capek.  menurut saya harga dan pelayanan sangat tidak sesuai. agak kecewa. rate roomnya 650 untuk deluxe. jadi, cukup kecewa ya, dan tidak akan kembali.  saran saya bagi yang mau kesini lebih baik pilih family room karena pasti di lereng.",good thing cool air and friendly security guard willing to take guest by motorbike because the distance between the parking lot and the hotel is quite far bad thing 1 random and unfair room selection i ordered a deluxe room and wa placed in the middle where many people passed by i will upload the picture honestly i didnt ask for it to be on a slope but with the position in the middle there is no privacy because if the window is opened other people can see u and finally i had to close the window because it wa uncomfortable if people saw u in my opinion there is no privacy provided by the hotel 2 staff who lack communication i wanted to order food but the staff suddenly said that the order wa closed even though there wa no written information even on the menu it say order can be made through the host at 07002100 and i ordered at 1830 how can guest know the closing time if they are not informed verbally or in writing 3 very hard mattress is it possible that because the concept is in the middle of the forest it is hard 4 there is no staff to help you carry your stuff up to the cabin so if you have a lot of stuff it will be tiring in my opinion the price and service are very inappropriate a bit disappointed the room rate is 650 for deluxe so im quite disappointed and i wont be back my advice for those who want to come here is to choose a family room because it definitely on a slope
Alexander Himawan,2.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,21,917,"saya dapat hrga promo 580k untuk duluxe room. very good place, suasana dingin berkabut mantap, super sejuk. view kota batu pagi & malam sangat spektakuler 🤝  disklaimer : saya bukan orang yang picky dalam hal hotel dan penginapan, saya agak kaget saja, padahal hrgnya lumayan tapi servis kurang sesuai harga.  beberapa point kekecewaan saya :  1. tidak bisa plih room, kami dapat cabin di depan jalan orang lewat, bukan yang seperti di ig, tiktok para influencer. kami cek ini jam 1 jam 2an. tamu baru ada 3 mobil include mobil saya, logika saya bisa dong plih tempat, kan harganya sama dengan yang view tebing. tidak bisa plih room karena random by sistem 🤝 yakali, sistem tinggal login admin, ganti room selesai. alesan yang aneh.  2. keadaan sore hujan sampai jam 6an sore, saya mau psen bbq, keadaan selesai hujan jam 6.30 saya psen, ternyta tidak bisa dengan alesan close order 6.15 yang mana tidak ada aturan tertulis close order bbq 6.15, setelah berdebat sbtr akhirnya saya bilang ""tolong di bantu"", akhirnya boleh pesan, untung boleh, kalo enggak boleh psen enggak jadi makan, padahal deh bawa daging sendiri untuk di bakar 🤝  3. masuk ke area lobi bobocabin lewat jalan kecil hanya cukup 1 mobil, waktu saya kesana tidak ada staff sama sekali yang menyambut di area pintu masuk. untung tidak ada mobil dari lwn arah waktu itu. well respect untuk para satpam disana, mereka antarkan customer dari lobi ke parkiran mbl naik motor sendiri dan bensin sendiri. saya kasih tips lah karena membantu 🤝  4. antara cs dan staff enggak sinkron, omongnnya ada yang enggak match, jadi ada beberapa hal yang miskom. mungkin kurang di brief oleh manajemennya.  kesimuplan, apakah worth untuk datang ke 2x ? no. cukup 1x kalo kamu belum pernah kesini, saya akuin memang untuk orang kota, suasan disini sangat healing. selama kualitas service belum di tingkatkan, datang ke 2x tidak dianjurkan 🙏 untuk harga yang sama 750 normal price, saya lebih plih amerta hills untuk nextnya. yang 1.5jt family cabin, bisa dapat 1 kamar golden tulip 🤝  saya kasih bintang 2 karena untuk mengapresiasi satpam dan udara yang sejuk 🤝",i got a promo price of 580k for duluxe room very good place cool foggy atmosphere super cool the view of batu city in the morning evening is very spectacular disclaimer im not a picky person when it come to hotel and lodging i wa a bit surprised even though the price wa quite good but the service wa not according to the price some of my disappointment 1 cant choose a room we got a cabin in front of the road where people pas by not the one on ig tiktok influencers we checked this at 1 am or 2 am there were only 3 new guest including my car logically i could choose a place the price is the same a the one with a cliff view cant choose a room because it random by the system maybe the system just log in to the admin change the room are done strange reason 2 it wa raining in the afternoon until 6 pm i wanted to order bbq the rain stopped at 630 i ordered but it turned out i couldnt with the excuse that the order close at 615 which is not written rule for closing bbq order at 615 after arguing for a while i finally said please help finally i wa allowed to order fortunately i wa allowed if i wasnt allowed to order i wouldnt have eaten even though i brought my own meat to grill 3 entering the bobocabin lobby area via a small road only enough for 1 car when i went there there wa no staff at all to greet me at the entrance area fortunately there were no car from the opposite direction at that time well respect for the security guard there they escorted customer from the lobby to the car parking lot by motorbike and their own gasoline i gave them tip because they helped 4 the c and staff were not in sync some of their word didnt match so there were several thing that were miscommunicated maybe it wasnt briefed by the management conclusion is it worth coming to 2x no 1x is enough if you have never been here i admit that for city people the atmosphere here is very healing a long a the quality of service ha not been improved coming to 2x is not recommended for the same price of 750 normal price i prefer amerta hill for the next one the 15jt family cabin can get 1 golden tulip room i give 2 star because to appreciate the security guard and the cool air

VC,2.0,2024-03-14 00:00:00,16,1030,"lokasi di gunung mas yang masih alam, jadi segar udaranya. karena sering gerimis, udara jadi dingin dan sering berkabut. lokasi parkir dan tempat menginap berseberangan, jadi agak repot kalau bawa barang yang tidak minimal. jadi harus drop off di lobby. lokasi menginap juga agak kurang bagus aksesnya, puterannya tidak terlalu terlihat, dan agak tinggi dan berbatu. mobil hati-hati kena bawahnya. saya lihat mobil ada yang kena bawahnya. lebih baik puter balik dulu baru naik ke lokasi menginap. lobby minimalis. untuk menginap di bobocabin, kita harus download aplikasinya ya. karena check ini, akses pintu kamar, room service, dan bahkan untuk mengendalikan jendela kamar pakai aplikai bobocabin. kecewa banget kita dapat kamar dengan cara random, tidak bisa memilih kamar. dapat kamar yang tidak mendapatkan view. hati-hati juga kalau keliling lokasi bobocabin, karena menemukan beberapa kotoran kucing di tangganya. minum hanya dapat 2 botol air mineral, tidak ada refill. kalau beli di bobocabin lumayan juga harganya…. makan pagi dapat 3 pilihan: nasi goreng, nasi uduk dan sandwich. rasa biasa saja, kurang oke sih. tidak disediakan kopi, jadi kalau peminum kopi, siapkan sendiri ya. lokasi kamar yang oke ada di atas2 bisa dapat view city light. tapi harus naik tangga yang lumayan tinggi. jadi enggak rekomen buat bawa orang tua atau anak-anak. dan yang paling enggak, lampu di kamar. lampu canggih yang bisa berubah warna, tapi sekali dimatikan langsung mati semua, jadi kalau malam mau ke toilet, nyalain lampu bakalan bangunin orang sekamar. enggak banget deh. ganggu sekali. room service tanggap untuk dipanggil. makan malam tidak lengkap sesuai dengan di menu, menu shabu2 tidak ada. hanya tersedia bbq.  sabun, shampoo, sikat gigi , odol, handuk, tisu, dan air panas oke.",location in the natural mountain ma so the air is fresh because it often drizzle the air becomes cold and often foggy the parking location and the place to stay are opposite so it a bit troublesome if you bring more than minimal item so you have to drop off at the lobby the place to stay is also not very good access the turn is not very visible and it a bit high and rocky be careful if the car get hit underneath i saw a car hit underneath it better to turn back first before going up to the place to stay minimalist lobby to stay at bobocabin we have to download the application because check in access to the room door room service and even to control the room window use the bobocabin application very disappointed we got a room randomly couldnt choose a room got a room that didnt get a view also be careful if you go around the bobocabin location because you found some cat feces on the stair drink only get 2 bottle of mineral water no refill if you buy at bobocabin the price is quite good breakfast get 3 choice fried rice uduk rice and sandwich the taste is just ordinary not okay no coffee provided so if you are a coffee drinker prepare your own the good room location is upstairs you can get a view of the city light but you have to climb quite a high staircase so it is not recommended for bringing elderly or child and the worst thing is the light in the room sophisticated light that can change color but once turned off they all go out immediately so if you want to go to the toilet at night turning on the light will wake up the people in the room not really very annoying room service is responsive when called dinner is not complete according to the menu there is no shabu menu only bbq is available soap shampoo toothbrush toothpaste towel tissue and hot water are okay

Zeneth Thobarony,5.0,2024-01-14 00:00:00,16,1041,"pertama kali mencoba bobocabin! sebenarnya ngincar yang baturaden, jadi yang gunung mas ini agak low expectation. ternyata sangat memuaskan!  dia posisinya di komplek agrowisata gunung mas, jadi harus bayar per-kendaraan dan per-jumlah orang. tapi kalau mau keluar masuk selama nginap bisa enggak bayar lagi kok, asal bilang sama petugas di gerbang agrowisata.  kita pesan cabin executive (yang king + queen bed), dari awal sudah dibilang sama cs posisinya di atas. kita memang incar di atas sih sebenarnya hehe, meski enggak dapat cabin 31 (paling tinggi :’).  kami keluarga dengan anak 3 (8, 4, 3). anak-anak bisa mandiri naik sendiri. barang juga dibantuin bawa sama staff bobocabin. meski begitu, tetap packing savvy ya, soalnya kalau kebanyakan bawa barang, susah melangkah di dalam ruangan.  kami bawa perlengkapan buat bakar-bakaran makanan kami sendiri. di kamar enggak ada kulkas, tapi bisa nitip freezer bobocabin. meski cabin saya bukan paling atas, tapi alhamdulillah sebelahan dengan ruang komunal dan sharing kitchen (isinya sink dan microwave), jadi bolak balik cuci piring sama microwave popcorn gampang hehe).  untuk sarapan katanya jam 7, tapi kenyataannya baru ready jam 7-an. cuma ada pilihan nasi uduk, nasi goreng, dan sandwich.  oh ya, anak-anak hepi banget keliling area bobocabin naik turun tangga eksplorasi. terus disekitaran ada kebun teh, bocah senang keluar masuk karena katanya kayak maze hehe. contohnya kan parkiran mobil jauh, itu kami turun ke parkiran lewat maze kebun teh biar jalan pintas.  bobocabin gunung mas sekomplek sama aktivitas agrowisata, jadi pakai mobil ngiterin dikit, ketemu keriaan hiburan agrowisata. yang terkenal ada srodotan donat. flying fox, sama tea bridge.  untuk keadaan dalam cabin, ada yang agak rerak terutama di bagian kamar mandi, soalnya kan sekatnya pakai triplek begitu, but nevermind.  so far puas banget. ini cocok banget buat slow travelling yang pengin malas-malasan menikmati alam dan tipis-tipis kegiatan di alam.  tidak rekomendasi untuk orang tua karena naiknya cukup lumayan.",first time trying bobocabin actually aiming for the baturaden one so this gunung ma one had a bit of a low expectation turned out to be very satisfying it located in the gunung ma agrotourism complex so you have to pay per vehicle and per person but if you want to go in and out during your stay you can pay without paying again a long a you tell the officer at the agrotourism gate we ordered an executive cabin king queen bed from the start the c told u that the position wa above we were actually aiming for the top hehe even though we didnt get cabin 31 the highest we are a family with 3 child 8 4 3 the child can climb up by themselves the bobocabin staff also helped u carry our stuff even so still pack savvy because if you bring too much stuff it hard to move around in the room we brought our own equipment to grill our food there no refrigerator in the room but you can ask for the bobocabin freezer even though my cabin isnt the top one thank god it next to a communal room and a sharing kitchen contains a sink and microwave so going back and forth to wash dish and microwave popcorn is easy hehe for breakfast it say at 7 but in reality it only ready at 7 there are only choice of uduk rice fried rice and sandwich oh yes the child were really happy going around the bobocabin area up and down the exploration stair then around there is a tea garden the kid like to go in and out because they say it like a maze hehe for example the car park is far away so we went down to the parking lot via the tea garden maze to take a shortcut bobocabin gunung ma is a complex a agrotourism activity so if you use a car with a small engine you can find fun agrotourism entertainment the famous one is the donut srodotan flying fox and tea bridge a for the situation inside the cabin there are some crack especially in the bathroom because the partition is made of plywood but nevermind so far very satisfied this is perfect for slow traveling who want to laze around enjoying nature and do a little bit of nature activity not recommended for the elderly because the climb is quite steep
Irfan,3.0,2024-01-14 00:00:00,16,1042,view dan nuansa bagus. tapi pelayanan kurang. sarapan telat datang.,nice view and ambiance but service is lacking breakfast is late to arrive
ini Emailku,4.0,2024-01-14 00:00:00,16,1043,"tidak cocok buat yang bawa orang tua.  kamarnya bagus, cuma ternyata disini masih belum dingin dan enggak disemua kabin bisa lihat lampu kota dari jauh.  jadi disini ada dua tipe, yang biasa dan eksekutif. yang biasa tempatnya dibawah yang eksekutif di atas. memang yang diatas view nya agak bagus, tapi naeknya juga lumayan capek.  pengalaman tidur di kabin juga lumayan, masuknya scan barcode, di dalam ada led yang bisa diubah2, ada backsound suara sungai/hutan. cuma kamar mandinya enggak ada kuncinya, jadi kalo bawa anak dan iseng jadi enggak nyaman kalo mau pup/mandi.  view nya lumayan bagus, apalagi pas malam lampu2 nya dinyalain, tapi ya sesuai selera sih, dan pas saya kesini kemarin, pas malam enggak dingin.  overall lumayan, tapi cukup sekali saja kesini.  ada beberapa yang kurang menurut saya 1. kita tetap harus bayar tiket masuk ke gunung mas, padahal sudah nginep harusnya sih gratis buat yang nginep. 2. parkiran motor bisa dekat loby, tapi parkiran mobil ada di bawah dan jaraknya lumayan, ribet saja sih kalo mau ambil barang yang ketinggalan. 3. naik ke kabin nya lumayan capek, tidak cocok buat orang tua. tapi kalo orang tuanya kuat sih enggak apa-apa juga. 4.ini stafnya kurang sat set atau memang lupa saya enggak tau, saya pesan kayu buat api unggun,dia sudah nyanggupin iya, katanya nanti bisa diantar, tapi mau di cek dulu ketersediannya. tapi sampai malam enggak ada kabar, jadi bikin bete, mau ke bawah nanyain juga sudah malea, capek jalannya. 5.sarapannya biasa saja. katanya bisa diantar, tapi sudah sampai jam 7 lewat enggak diantar, akhirnya disamperin ke tempat makan. dan ternyata masih belum siap harus menunggu. sudah bilang dari kabin nomor sekian, katanya suruh menunggu sebentar. tapi sampai setengah jam belum juga diantar. eh malah orang yang datang setelah saya sudah pada dikasih makanya. saya kira makannya beda, ternyata baru ingat, sarapannya cuma ada 3 macam, nasi goreng, nasi uduk dan sandwich. dan setelah didatangi lagi baru dikasih, dan itupun harus menunggu. setelah makannya datang, saya kira masih anget, ternyata semua makannya dingin, lah kalo begitu mengapai saya harus menunggu setengah jam  😩, ini parah sih, dan rasanya b saja.  tapi btw ini pengalaman saya, bisa jadi berbeda di setiap orang.  oh iya, cabin yang view nya bagus itu menurut saya no 31, 10 dan kalo enggak salah ingat no 20. dengan harga yang sama tapi viewnya lebih, tapi no 31 itu paling atas, jadi ya ke kabin nya juga bikin capek.",not suitable for those brought by parent the room is nice but it turn out that it is still not cold here and not all cabin can see the city light from afar so here there are two type ordinary and executive the usual place is below the executive above it true that the view above is quite good but the climb is also quite tiring the experience of sleeping in the cabin is also good barcode scanning is included inside there are led that can be changed there is a background sound of the riverforest only the bathroom doesnt have a lock so if you bring a child and play around it wont be comfortable if you want to take a showershower the view is pretty good especially at night when the light are on but yes it suit my taste and when i came here yesterday it wasnt cold at night good overall but only once here is enough there are a few thing that are lacking in my opinion 1 we still have to pay for the entrance ticket to gunung ma even though we have already stayed it should be free for those who stay 2 the motorcycle parking can be near the lobby but the car parking is below and it quite a distance it just complicated if you want to pick up the item you left behind 3 going up to the cabin is quite tiring not suitable for the elderly but if the parent are strong it okay 4 this staff lack a set or really forgot i dont know i ordered wood for the bonfire he already accepted it he said it can be delivered later but he want to check the availability first but until the night there wa no news so i made a bete wanted to go down to ask and wa already tired tired of walking 5 the breakfast is normal he said it could be delivered but it wasnt delivered until 7 oclock finally he wa sent to the restaurant and it turn out it not ready yet have to wait already said from cabin number so he said to wait for a while but it hasnt been delivered until half an hour eh even the people who came after me have already been given that i thought it wa different but i just remembered that there are only 3 type of breakfast fried rice fried rice and sandwich and after being approached again it is only given and even that ha to wait after the food came i thought it wa still warm but it turned out that all the food wa cold so why do i have to wait half an hour this is really bad and it just feel bad but btw this is my experience it can be different for each person oh yes i think the cabin with the best view is no 31 10 and if i remember correctly no 20 with the same price but the view is more but no 31 is the highest so yes going to the cabin also make you tired

pesan makanan? tanya ini itu? tinggal chat host dari aplikasi. jadi jangan ngedumel ya kalo disuruh install aplikasi. proses check-ini nya cepat dan gampang banget kok. 5. akses - karena lokasinya agak dalem, memang cari makan agak susah sih. tapi kalo bawa mobil pribadi ya enggak masalah. sampai malam ada yang jaga, so don't worry kalo kamu baliknya malam. makanan bisa pesan di sini juga, memang harganya lebih mahal tapi ya namanya juga hotel, semua pasti lebih mahal lah. tapi bukan yang enggak ngotak juga mahalnya. kalo indak mau ya gofood saja. nanti abang gofood nganter sampai lobby, dari lobby staff nya bobocabin yang antarkan ke tempat kamu.  overall ini menurutku worth the price. ya jangan mengharap ini itu yang berlebihan juga, kan harganya 700ribuan, bukan 2 juta per malam. selamat liburan!",overall a great experience the place is suitable for all atmosphere for family vacation gathering with friend or couple worth it for the price of 700 thousand per night i will review each point one by one so you know what to expect and prepare 1 cabin the cabin is compact but not uncomfortably small it decently sized and there are also different room size available so it can be adjusted to the number of people the smart window is fun there are special sound effect of river sound or forest bird chirping the light can also be changed the window glass can be blurred a needed the bathroom is nice there is 15l of hot water if it run out it take 2 hour to heat it up again there is a coffee pot cup and mineral water there is no refrigerator the bed and pillow are comfortable the blanket is thick so you dont have to worry about getting cold wifi is available yes sometimes it not that fast but it quite good 2 location important to note the parking lot is far away from other review many may have said so it a long way and the road is rocky so if you can dont bring a suitcase because you wont be able to pull it you have to carry it the road will be a bit uphill and later the location of the cabin will also be high so get ready to lift thing while hiking a little at night there are lot of light it really beautiful 3 service top the host and staff are all very nice ready to help we were offered to be taken by motorbike or borrowed the motorbike to get tofrom the parking lot because it wa so far away when i just arrived the security guy helped carry the bag using his motorbike because the komodo vehicle he wa helping carry wa broken this message also arrived quickly everyone is really friendly 4 checkin process before coming research first the bobocabin us a smart lock so the key is using a qr code from your cellphone so when you check it you will be asked to download the bobobox application dont worry the host will help you and all your need will be done through the application would you like to ask for extra towel order food ask this or that just chat with the host from the application so dont grumble if youre told to install the application the checkin process is fast and really easy 5 access because the location is quite deep finding food is a bit difficult but if you bring a private car thats no problem there someone on guard until evening so dont worry if you come back at night you can order food here too the price is more expensive but yes it also a hotel everything is definitely more expensive but it not something that doesnt matter it also expensive if you dont want to just gofood later brother gofood will deliver you to the lobby from the lobby the bobocabin staff will deliver it to your place overall i think this is worth the price yes dont expect this to be excessive either the price is 700 thousand not 2 million per night happy holiday

reeva damayanti,3.0,2024-06-12 00:00:00,19,1368,"1. pas jalan menuju bobocabin kaget dengan lokasinya yang begitu terpencil, masuk ke lorong2 warga, dengan jalanan yang sempit bahkan mobil pun takut dengan jalan itu, jalanannya masih rusak, kalau berpapasan dengan mobil lain salah satu harus mundur, tidak ada penerang jalan kalau malam, lokasinya sangat jauh dari warung-warung sehingga untuk makan siang kalau tidak pesan di bobocabin ya harus keluar. dan tidak ada gojek/gocar di wilayah ini. bersyukur kalau datang menggunakan kendaraan pribadi. kalau beruntung bisa dapat driver lokal yang siap antar kemanapun :)  2. awal sampai kaget juga dengan lalat, saya pikir karena berdiri dekat tempat sampah hehe. ternyata di kintamani banyak lalat karena wilayah perkebunan dan menggunakan pupuk dari ayam (katanya). hanya saja lalatnya sedikit mengganggu :( kurang nyaman berada di luar ruangan karena lalat.  3. harga sangat tidak sesuai, saya memesan kamar dengan harga 1jt dengan fasilitas bak mandi air hangat yang ada di luar sesuai gambar pada traveloka. tapi nyatanya bak dengan lumut, air kuning dan sangat panas, ini seperti sumur bukan bak mandi :) mana mungkin berendam disitu ? tidak seperti di bobocabin ubud yang memang bak untuk berendam. tau begitu saya pilih kamar yang biasa :)  4. kamar bersih tetapi sempit, dengan harga segitu :) kamar mandi juga sempit dan pintunya susah ditutup. air suka dimatikan, saya baca perorang 15ltr untuk 90mnt (kalau tidak salah ingat) dan saya sudah menunggu tapi nyatanya airnya tetap dimatikan dan tidak tau kapan deras lagi.  5. check ini harus menggunakan aplikasi, semua canggih dengan sistem. sayangnya jaringan disana tidak terlalu bagus, sehingga susah berkomunikasi menggunakan aplikasi, dan lampunya serta jendelamu suka macet. dan tidak ada wifi.  6. penggunaan listrik sangat dibatasi.  7. sarapan harus by order 1 hari sebelumnya. dan itu diantarkan ke kamar masing-masing sangat kama karena saya lihat hanya 1 orang yang antar makanan 1 per 1 :( dan karena semua by sistem, jaringan jelek, kalau tidak menjawab makan apa besok, tidak ada staf yang menghampiri di kamar untuk tanya, bisa-bisa malah enggak makan :( rasa makanan biasa saja dengan harga begitu mahal bahkan hanya seadanya.  8. staf nya kurang peka. kami mengangkat koper sendiri padahal ada staf di dekat situ.  9. cuaca di pagi hari sangat dingin, tetapi mulai jam 10 ke atas sangat panas bahkan di dalam ruangan pun meski pakai ac tetap panas, dan entah kenapa saya pusing berada dalam kabin apa karena pengap ? tidak ada udara ? dan cuaca malam sangat dingin.  10. masukan saya mungkin bisa ditambahkan tv untuk hiburan saat malam atau siang saat tamu tidak ingin kemana2.  11. pemandangan bagus seperti di lukisan :)  12. apakah tidak ada service untuk bersihkan kamar ?",1 on the way to bobocabin i wa surprised by it remote location entering the alley of resident with narrow road even car are afraid of the road the road is still damaged if you meet another car one of you ha to reverse there are no street light at night the location is very far from the stall so for lunch if you dont order at bobocabin you have to go out and there are no gojekgocar in this area be grateful if you come using a private vehicle if you are lucky you can get a local driver who is ready to take you anywhere 2 at the beginning i wa also surprised by the fly i thought it wa because i wa standing near the trash hehe it turn out that in kintamani there are lot of fly because it is a plantation area and us fertilizer from chicken they said it just that the fly are a bit annoying it not comfortable to be outside because of the fly 3 the price is very inappropriate i booked a room for 1 million with a hot water bathtub facility outside according to the picture on traveloka but in fact the tub wa covered in moss yellow water and very hot it wa like a well not a bathtub how could you soak there unlike in bobocabin ubud which is indeed like a bath if i had known i would have chosen a regular room 4 the room is clean but cramped for that price the bathroom is also cramped and the door is hard to close the water often get turned off i read per person 15 liter for 90 minute if i remember correctly and ive been waiting but in fact the water is still turned off and i dont know when it will flow again 5 check this must use the application everything is sophisticated with the system unfortunately the network there is not very good so it is difficult to communicate using the application and the light and your window often get stuck and there is no wifi 6 electricity usage is very limited 7 breakfast must be by order 1 day in advance and it wa delivered to each room very roomy because i saw only 1 person who delivered food 1 by 1 and because everything is by system bad network if you dont answer what to eat tomorrow no staff will come to the room to ask you might not even eat the taste of the food is ordinary with such an expensive price even just enough 8 the staff is not sensitive we lifted the suitcase ourselves even though there wa staff nearby 9 the weather in the morning is very cold but from 10 onwards it is very hot even inside the room even though the air conditioner is still hot and for some reason i got dizzy being in the cabin is it because it stuffy no air and the night weather is very cold 10 my input maybe a tv can be added for entertainment at night or during the day when guest dont want to go anywhere 11 nice view like in a painting 12 is there no service to clean the room
Ragil Intan Novitasari,4.0,2024-06-12 00:00:00,19,1369,"before i choose this acomodation i've read a lot of review from ag*di* actually, that's why i try my best to reach this place before night fall.  since i trust google maps for direction, also to this accomodation, i've choosen the shortest path, but it also a nerve-wrecking path.  about 3km long before our destination, we've been directed to the small and steep road (about 50 - 70 slope degrees), we take this hellish road (especially for car) about 1km long and finally got normal road (even it's still quite narrow), after 1,5km we've got directed to another insanely small road which is only passable by motorbike (probably, as i saw it), luckily, we selamat a local resident wise enough to prevent us going through those route.  then, he direct us to another path, a little bumpy but passed well. and finally, we reached this acomodation after dusk (just after sunset).  and the fun fact is, we decide to take another route, which is far reasonable, and suitable for normal-human.  there's no desk at the lobby and only 1 receptionist guiding us. to di check ini, i download bobobo* aplication, fill ini my data and then check ini process through this apps, we didn't get physical key, as to open the door we simply scan barcode through bobobo* aplication.  as for check out process, is also by bobobo* apps. but, still needs confirmation by the staff on site.  i booked deluxe room, which is the cheapest room i thought, but i don't feel any big difference about the service. i got room number 26 which is close to the lobby.  for the room it's must be standard for the cabin, quite small 2,25 kali 6 sama aproximately, but it clean, smell good and still well maintain. there is a lot of instruction inside the room, about the fly, the water and more.  personaly i'sama not satisfied with the water heater cause it's provide small amount of water, which is i dont finish my bath and the water turn cold. the heating proses also take too long.  and for the bathroom it's leaked if we don't close ia properly, good thing is the shower type memakai it easier for us, muslim to take a wudhu.  i also didn't matched the toilet type, which didn't provide a bidet, so it's hard for me who travel with kids.  they provide hair driyer but i don't use it.  the ac performance was great, it warm us ini the night and chill us ini the noon, it makes the room comfortable. (you should close the cover lid for the main window if you don't want your room heating a lot)  it's so cold outside when its night, but it's worthy to walk around to sih the night-view, light of down-village and also the starry sky (luckily we stay when the sky is clear). the surounding was quite, but if someone loudly talk it will be heard by the neighbour, so i'sama not quite recomended this acomodation for newly wed couple who want a hot night, hahha.  ini the morning the fly started to appear, and there' a lot, quite annoying actually, especialy when breakfast time (but from what i learned, all this district have a lot of fly). about food, we order through chat ini the aplication. for the menu, it's too simple and no much option, but when i imagine the hard time we reach this place, i feel it's understandable. for the amenities, i'sama just a bit sad cause they only provide tea without coffee.  the view? no need to question it. it was so amazing, take a walk ini the morning and we can sih the lake also the mount peak perfectly accompanied by the beatiful cloud.  however for me it's a worthy new experience, stay ini the so called high tech acomodation with great view. will i repeat? probably ini another place of this acomodation when it have a promo ofcourse, hehhe.  my kids amazed with the high tech feature. how the lamp change, how the window get blur and they love the windows style. they just complain about the room size, which is too narrow for them.",before i choose this acomodation ive read a lot of review from agdi actually thats why i try my best to reach this place before night fall since i trust google map for direction also to this accomodation ive choosen the shortest path but it also a nervewrecking path about 3km long before our destination weve been directed to the small and steep road about 50 70 slope degree we take this hellish road especially for car about 1km long and finally got normal road even it still quite narrow after 15km weve got directed to another insanely small road which is only passable by motorbike probably a i saw it luckily we selamat a local resident wise enough to prevent u going through those route then he direct u to another path a little bumpy but passed well and finally we reached this acomodation after dusk just after sunset and the fun fact is we decide to take another route which is far reasonable and suitable for normalhuman there no desk at the lobby and only 1 receptionist guiding u to di check ini i download bobobo aplication fill ini my data and then check ini process through this apps we didnt get physical key a to open the door we simply scan barcode through bobobo aplication a for check out process is also by bobobo apps but still need confirmation by the staff on site i booked deluxe room which is the cheapest room i thought but i dont feel any big difference about the service i got room number 26 which is close to the lobby for the room it must be standard for the cabin quite small 225 kali 6 sama aproximately but it clean smell good and still well maintain there is a lot of instruction inside the room about the fly the water and more personaly isama not satisfied with the water heater cause it provide small amount of water which is i dont finish my bath and the water turn cold the heating prose also take too long and for the bathroom it leaked if we dont close ia properly good thing is the shower type memakai it easier for u muslim to take a wudhu i also didnt matched the toilet type which didnt provide a bidet so it hard for me who travel with kid they provide hair driyer but i dont use it the ac performance wa great it warm u ini the night and chill u ini the noon it make the room comfortable you should close the cover lid for the main window if you dont want your room heating a lot it so cold outside when it night but it worthy to walk around to sih the nightview light of downvillage and also the starry sky luckily we stay when the sky is clear the surounding wa quite but if someone loudly talk it will be heard by the neighbour so isama not quite recomended this acomodation for newly wed couple who want a hot night hahha ini the morning the fly started to appear and there a lot quite annoying actually especialy when breakfast time but from what i learned all this district have a lot of fly about food we order through chat ini the aplication for the menu it too simple and no much option but when i imagine the hard time we reach this place i feel it understandable for the amenity isama just a bit sad cause they only provide tea without coffee the view no need to question it it wa so amazing take a walk ini the morning and we can sih the lake also the mount peak perfectly accompanied by the beatiful cloud however for me it a worthy new experience stay ini the so called high tech acomodation with great view will i repeat probably ini another place of this acomodation when it have a promo ofcourse hehhe my kid amazed with the high tech feature how the lamp change how the window get blur and they love the window style they just complain about the room size which is too narrow for them
Lorenz Abraham Pesik,2.0,2024-05-13 00:00:00,19,1370,"review jujur bobocabin kintamani  1. akses sangat sulit, jalan bebatuan krikil dan hanya bisa dilalui 1 mobil, jadi kalau ada mobil dari lawan arah siap² harus ada yang mengalah.  2. service sangat buruk, tidak ada karyawan yang membantu untuk angkat barang², hari ini check out saya dari kamar paling bawah nomor 15 angkat barang² cukup banyak dan petugas hanya melihat saja tidak membantu sama sekali bahkan tidak menyapa tamu nya.  3. untuk kamar sangat sempit, jadi kalau ada yang ingin bermalam disini baiknya membawa barang seperlunya saja. harga kamar tidak sesuai dengan kamarnya.  4. view nya? jangan di ragukan lagi sudah pasti bagus.  5. saran jika ingin bermalam disini baiknya datang sebelum gelap karena tidak ada penerangan jalan akses menuju bobocabin.",honest review of bobocabin kintamani 1 access is very difficult the road is gravel and can only be passed by 1 car so if there is a car coming from the opposite direction be prepared to have to give way 2 the service is very bad there are no employee to help with lifting thing today i checked out from the lowest room number 15 lifting quite a lot of thing and the officer just looked at them and didnt help at all and didnt even greet the guest 3 the room are very narrow so if someone want to spend the night here it best to bring only what they need the room price doe not match the room 4 the view dont doubt it it definitely good 5 advice if you want to spend the night here it best to come before dark because there is no lighting on the access road to the bobocabin

Jaka Dharma,1.0,2024-05-13 00:00:00,19,1387,"saya harus memberikan review yang jujur, atas pengalaman saya bermalam di bobocabin kintamani,..  saya menginap bersama dengan keluarga saya saat itu , saya menginap hanya 1 hari di bobocabin kintamani, karena di musim yang high season di libur lebaran 2024 , akhirnya saya memesan 2 unit tipe kamar (deluxe cabin & executive cabin) yang terdapat di hari tersebut.  singkat cerita , value for money sangatlah tidak sesuai !! dengan harga lebih dari 3,6 juta saat itu (di high season ) , apa yang saya rasakan saat menginap di bobocabin kintamani tidaklah sesuai dengan harga yang sudah dikeluarkan .  saya sendiri menginap di tipe kamar executive cabin ( tipe yang tertinggi di bobocabin kintamani ). kondisi kamar yang menurut saya kurang terawat, dari mulai pintu handle besi yang terlihat sudah usang ditambah dengan tambahan pintu anti nyamuk yang sudah rusak. pengalaman pahit tidak hanya disitu , saat saya menggunakan kamar mandi untuk mandi di sore hari, bocor dari kamar mandi tampak menggenang ke luar dari shower box , alhasil area kamar mandi tampak becek dengan air yang keluar.  proses pemesanan, booking kamar, hingga check-ini dan check-out memang terlihat cukup canggih dan kekinian dan juga update dengan teknologi berbentuk aplikasi langsung dari hp tamu, namun tampak jelas sekali manajemen bobocabin kintamani disini terkesan mau irit ! dan mungkin enggan menambah jumlah karyawan untuk bobocabin kintamani , anda bisa bayangkan proses reservasi saat itu hanya dibantu oleh 1 orang karyawan saja yang bertugas, bahkan saya juga tidak tega meskipun karyawan tersebut ingin membantu untuk mengangkat koper2 /barang saya , padahal bisa dibayangkan dari total 31 cabin yang terdapat di bobocabin kintamani saya hanya melihat beberapa karyawan saja saat itu. malah terkesan terlihat seperti sepi .  keesokan harinya disaat sarapan pagi yang disediakan oleh bobocabin kintamani, sarapan yang tersedia yaitu hanya ada varian american breakfast dan juga indonesia breakfast, yang cukup mengagetkan saya hingga susah berucap ialah tampilan menu makanan tersebut saat dihidangkan ke saya dan keluarga saya .yakni sangat..sangat..sangat tidak sesuai dengan harga yang saat itu dikenakan kepada tamu.  makanan american breakfast dan juga indonesia breakfast terkesan dibuat hanya dengan sekedarnya saja malah seperti terlihat seperti mainan , rasanya pun berantakan sekali dengan kualitas bahan makanan yang menurut saya sangat rendah,roti,sosis,beef bacon dll.  saya sendiri cukup kaget bobocabin bukan hanya ada di kintamani bali , namun ada juga di beberapa kota lain di indonesia dan wisata alam lainnya, tapi apa begini semua kualitasnya ? coba tanyakan sendiri ke manajemen bobocabin kintamani , kalian mematok harga kamar tapi dengan kualitas kamar seperti itu ke tamu kalian yang akan menginap di bobocabin ??  saya yakin mungkin banyak yang sependapat dengan saya, untuk menulis review jujur seperti ini , namun itu urung dilakukan kayaknya karena terasa malas , buang2 waktu atau mungkin ambil tindakan untuk cukup 1 kali saja menginap di bobocabin kintamani karena akan mikir dua kali untuk menginap lagi di bobocabin kintamani , namun disisi lain saya harus memberikan penilaian ini agar manajemen bobocabin kintamani harus berbenah dan membuka matanya atas kekurangan kekurangan tersebut.  saya juga harus memberikan penilaian yang adil , bahwa area communal yang terdapat di area kanan dari lobby sangat bagus dan juga keramah tamahan para pegawai nya sangat baik untuk melayani para tamu yang menginap.  dan satu lagi , saran saya manajemen bobocabin kintamani juga harus adil , karena review yang kurang baik tidak pernah ada di posting di aplikasi bobobox , padahal itu seharusnya menjadi bahan pertimbangan manajemen bobocabin kintamani untuk dapat mengevaluasi pelayanan kalian.  terima kasih  jack.",i have to give an honest review on my experience staying overnight at bobocabin kintamani i stayed with my family at that time i only stayed 1 day at bobocabin kintamani because in the high season on the 2024 eid holiday finally i booked 2 room type deluxe cabin executive cabin that were available on that day long story short the value for money is very inappropriate with a price of more than 36 million at that time in high season what i felt when staying at bobocabin kintamani did not match the price that had been spent i myself stayed in the executive cabin room type the highest type at bobocabin kintamani the condition of the room which in my opinion is not well maintained starting from the iron handle door that look worn out plus the addition of a broken mosquito repellent door the bitter experience is not only there when i used the bathroom to take a shower in the afternoon the leak from the bathroom seemed to pool out of the shower box a a result the bathroom area looked muddy with water coming out the reservation process room booking to checkin and checkout doe look quite sophisticated and contemporary and also updated with technology in the form of application directly from the guest cellphone but it is very clear that the management of bobocabin kintamani here seems to want to save money and maybe reluctant to increase the number of employee for bobocabin kintamani you can imagine the reservation process at that time wa only assisted by 1 employee on duty even i also did not have the heart even though the employee wanted to help lift my suitcase belonging even though you can imagine from a total of 31 cabin in bobocabin kintamani i only saw a few employee at that time instead it seemed deserted the next day at breakfast provided by bobocabin kintamani the breakfast available wa only american breakfast and indonesian breakfast variant what surprised me enough to have difficulty speaking wa the appearance of the food menu when served to me and my family which is veryveryvery not in accordance with the price that wa charged to guest at that time american breakfast and indonesian breakfast seem to be made with just a little bit even like toy the taste is also very messy with the quality of food ingredient which in my opinion are very low bread sausage beef bacon etc i myself am quite surprised that bobocabin is not only in kintamani bali but also in several other city in indonesia and other natural attraction but is this all the quality try asking the management of bobocabin kintamani yourself you set a room price but with a room quality like that for your guest who will stay at bobocabin im sure many may agree with me to write an honest review like this but it seems like it wa not done because it felt lazy a waste of time or maybe take action to just stay at bobocabin kintamani once because you will think twice about staying again at bobocabin kintamani but on the other hand i have to give this assessment so that the management of bobocabin kintamani must improve and open their eye to these shortcoming i also have to give a fair assessment that the communal area located in the right area of ​​the lobby is very good and also the friendliness of the employee is very good to serve the guest who stay and one more thing my suggestion is that the management of bobocabin kintamani must also be fair because bad review are never posted on the bobobox application even though it should be a consideration for bobocabin kintamani management to be able to evaluate your service thank you jack

Dinda Annisa,3.0,2024-03-14 00:00:00,19,1399,"sebenarnya banyak pilihan penginapan di daerah ini, tapi akhirnya memutuskan pilih bobocabin karena bentuk kamarnya yang bukan tenda dan ada kamar mandi di dalam dan rekomendasi dari jasa jeep tour..  sebelum booking, kita memakai sure dulu akses jalanannya bagaimana, menurut cs jalanan hanya muat satu mobil dan kalau ada mobil lainnya salah satu harus mengalah mundur, brt masalah akses sudah selesai..  kita hitung2 karena jalanan sudah terbayang, makanya kita kesini enggak mau terlalu malam karena takut enggak ada lampu di jalanan. di perjalanan kesini memang agak berkelok2 tapi okelah pakai raize, enggak terbayang kalo kita ambil mobil yang enggak tipe kayak raize begitu, petunjuknya menurut saya ok enggak bikin bingung, check ini dan sebagai ok, dapat kamar cabin 1 yang lokasinya diujung banget dekat komunal..  sampai kamar masih aman, bersih, ac berfungsi dengan baik, malam2 keadaan ok semua.. nah menjelang pagi baru kelihatan jadi banyak lalat, habis hujan makin banyak lalat lagi, air kran mati 2x di hari itu pagi dan sore, coba makan pagi di luar kayaknya salah, lalatnya ampun, sampai masuk2 kamar, di jakarta nepokin nyamuk, di bali nepokin lalat 😅  duduk di komunal juga dikerubutin lalat, sampai menempel banget itu lalat bingung kita, di bak mandi air panas juga banyak lalat, di meja luar kita pancing pakai gelas biar disitu saja tuh lalat enggak masuk ke kamar  masa serum wajah disemutin? tempat sampah di luar pagi2 masih ada sampahnya, bagaimana enggak banyak lalat  sarapan okelah, memilih nasi goreng pakai telor, minumnya teh panas, ya oke saja enggak enak2 banget juga  disini ada satu kucing, kayaknya sudah tua, kesian seperti sakit dan kurang minum, kedinginan pula, titip pesan saja untuk kalian yang mau menginap disini bawa whiskas ya buat sih meong 😁 tapi sampahnya langsung dibuang dan dibersihkan ya..",actually there are many accommodation option in this area but in the end we decided to choose bobocabin because the room is not a tent and there is a bathroom inside and it wa recommended by a jeep tour service before booking we first make sure how the road access is according to c the road only fit one car and if there is another car one of them ha to give in and back out so the access problem ha been resolved we calculated that because the road is already shaded thats why we didnt want to come here too late at night because we were afraid there wouldnt be any light on the road on the way here it wa a bit winding but it wa okay to use raize i cant imagine if we took a car that wasnt the type like raize the instruction in my opinion were ok it wouldnt make you confused check this and ok you got cabin 1 which is located at the very end near the communal area until the room wa still safe clean the ac wa functioning well at night everything wa okay well towards morning it seemed like there were lot of fly after the rain there were even more fly the tap water wa turned off twice that day in the morning and afternoon try eating breakfast outside i think it wrong the fly are merciful they come into the room in jakarta they get mosquito in bali they get fly sitting in the communal area is also surrounded by fly until they really stick the fly confuse u in the hot tub there are also lot of fly on the outside table we use fishing rod just leave the glass there so the fly wont come into the room when the facial serum is smeared on it there still rubbish in the trash can outside in the morning how come there arent a lot of fly breakfast is okay choose fried rice with an egg drink hot tea it okay it not really good there also a cat here it look like it old it feel like it sick and doesnt drink enough it cold also just leave a message for those of you who want to stay here to bring a whiskey itll do meow but the rubbish will be thrown away and cleaned straight away
Julia Ong,1.0,2024-03-14 00:00:00,19,1400,"jujur sangat amat kecewa enggak baca google review dulu sebelum book stay di bobocabin kintamani. ekspektasi sudah tinggi banget dari awal karena banyak banget teman-teman yang recommend untuk stay di bobocabin minimal sekali dalam seumur hidup. yang enggak diperhitungkan adalah tidak semua bobocabin bakal memberikan experience yang sama ya :) dari segi akses kesana, pelayanan bahkan view sangat sangat mengecewakan ya. saya jabarkan pengalaman2 yang saya dapatkan dari tempat ini dalam poin2 berikut.  1. akses masuk kesana susah banget. jalan sempit & jelek. sangat tidak recommend untuk bawa mobil yang lebar atau pendek. fyi, kami berempat dengan banyak bawaan jadi memang terpaksa harus pakai mobil. kalau pakai motor, tetap mesti hati-hati karena jalannya jelek & enggak jelas.  2. pelayanan buruk. ini sih sangat-sangat bikin emosi ya jujur. jadi awalnya kami pesan paket bundling dinner romantic ini kintamani. benar-benar book dari bobocabin & payment ke bobocabin langsung dan untuk valentine's day. sampai di bobocabin langsung check-ini kemudian teman saya tanya soal dinnernya nanti dimana & jam berapa begitu. lalu staffnya kaget seolah2 enggak tau kalau kami ada pesan paket bundling. lucu banget enggak sih. kok ya iso begitu. lalu meminta ditunjukin bukti pesan paket tersebut kemudian dia bilang ""saya coba tanyakan ke kitchen dulu ya"". lah? perannya enggak kebalik ya? bukannya harusnya dari resepsionis yang infokan ke kitchen dari awal sebelum kami stay juga? emosi tapi masih ditahan dengan pikiran gapapa deh asal tetap makan saja. kami tunggu infonya terus sambil menahan lapar sampai jam 7an malam baru staffnya datang ke cabin dengan kabar buruk. mereka enggak bisa provide itu karena biasa itu yang masak dari pihak ketiga. terbayang enggak sih sudah kelaperan banget terus dibilang begitu. sebel kali sumpah. lalu kata mereka akan mereka coba bantu ajukan ke pusat untuk refund. mereka ada itikad baik untuk kasih kompensasi berupa daging untuk panggang2 sih. kami juga sudah laper yaudahlah gas. terus dagingnya dianternya hampir jam 9. dagingnya juga bukan yang fresh begitu & tanpa bumbu. kecewa banget sih kok valentine's day makanan kami malah begitu wkwk padahal kan memang sengaja demi2 atur tripnya di tanggal 14 biar dapat feel ""romantic dinner""nya wkwk capek  3. staffnya enggak jelas. jadi kami mau ambil paket jeep tour untuk lihat sunrise di besokan harinya. dari staff bobocabin (a) bantu carikan & sudah dapat. kemudian untuk bookingan langsung direct ke pihak ketiga. jadi saya contact sendiri untuk booking & janjian dengan pihak ketiga & driver (beda orang) untuk dijemput jam 4 subuh. semua sudah ok. tiba-tiba besok jam 2.40 subuh, staff bobocabin lain (b) yang dari awal enggak pernah chat sama saya, infokan kalau trip dicancel karena driver sakit. lah. saya sudah kayak ya gajadi begitu. tapi setelah dipikir2 kan saya booking sendiri & saya sudah chat dengan driver untuk janjian. kalaupun driver benar-benar sakit kenapa yang info ke saya itu staff bobocabin. ada yang aneh nih. jadi saya chat langsung ke pihak ketiga dan ternyata benar. trip enggak ada dicancel. yang disampaikan pihak bobocabin itu enggak benar. sumpah ini kerjanya bagaimana sih orgnya? seenak jidatnya mau cancel2in trip orang sudah begitu subuh2 loh ini. masalahnya dia enggak rugi apa-apa. pihak ketiga yang dirugikan. bayangkan saja abang2 drivernya subuh2 datang nanti mau jemput siapa. cust ghoib? untung saja pikiran masih jernih walau setengah sadar baca chat dari staff itu lalu kepikiran untuk chat konfirmasi sendiri. satu2nya decision paling benar yang saya lakukan selama stay disini. untung tetap ikut jeep tour dengan bli2 yang sangat baik & totalitas banget kerjanya. enggak tega rasanya kalau bli2 yang baik banget itu dibeginikan.  4. masalah lalat ya benar-benar deh. memang sih dataran tinggi banyak lalat dimana mana itu wajar banget. cuma luar biasa banyak sumpah kalau disini. saya ada nginap di daerah lain di kintamani. memang lalatnya dimana mana tapi masih enggak separah disini.  5. bonus masuk kecoa ke dalam cabin ya ges ya. semua pintu tertutup rapat loh. bisa-bisanya ada kecoa  ya limit. masih banyak lagi padahal :) btw viewnya tidak worth sama sekali!!",honestly very very disappointed not to read google review first before booking stay at bobocabin kintamani expectation wa already very high from the beginning because many friend recommended to stay at bobocabin at least once in a lifetime what wa not taken into account is not all bobocabin will give the same experience yes in term of access there service and even the view is very very disappointing yes i describe the experience that i got from this place in the following point 1 access there is very difficult narrow bad road highly not recommended to bring a wide or short car fyi there were four of u with a lot of luggage so we were forced to use a car if using a motorbike still have to be careful because the road is bad unclear 2 bad service this is veryvery emotional to be honest so initially we ordered this romantic dinner bundling package kintamani really book from bobocabin payment to bobocabin directly and for valentine day arrived at bobocabin immediately checkin then my friend asked about dinner later where what time then the staff wa shocked a if they didnt know that we had ordered a bundling package isnt that funny why is that then asked to show proof of the package order then he said let me ask the kitchen first huh the role werent reversed right shouldnt the receptionist inform the kitchen from the start before we stayed too emotional but still held back with the thought that it wa okay a long a we still ate we waited for the information while holding back our hunger until 7 pm then the staff came to the cabin with bad news they couldnt provide it because usually the cook wa from a third party can you imagine being so hungry and then being told that really annoying i swear then they said they would try to help u submit it to the center for a refund they had good intention to give compensation in the form of meat for grilling we were also hungry so let go then the meat wa delivered at almost 9 am the meat wa also not fresh and without seasoning really disappointed why our valentine day food wa like that lol even though we deliberately arranged the trip on the 14th so we could get a romantic dinner feel lol tired 3 the staff wa unclear so we wanted to take the jeep tour package to see the sunrise the next day from the bobocabin staff a helped find it got it then for booking directly to the third party so i contacted myself to book make an appointment with the third party driver different people to be picked up at 4 am everything wa ok suddenly tomorrow at 240 am another bobocabin staff b who had never chatted with me from the start informed me that the trip wa canceled because the driver wa sick nah i wa like it didnt happen but after thinking about it i booked it myself i had chatted with the driver to make an appointment even if the driver wa really sick why wa the bobocabin staff the one who informed me something wa strange so i chatted directly to the third party and it turned out to be true the trip wa not canceled what bobocabin said is not true i swear how do these people work they can cancel people trip at will so early in the morning the problem is that they dont lose anything the third party is the one who is harmed just imagine who the driver will come at dawn to pick up who is the ghost luckily my mind wa still clear even though i wa halfconscious reading the chat from the staff and then thought about chatting to confirm it myself the only right decision i made during my stay here luckily i still joined the jeep tour with bli2 who wa very kind really dedicated to his work i cant bear it if bli2 who is very kind is treated like this 4 the problem with fly is really true it true that there are fly everywhere in the highland thats normal it just that there are so many here ive stayed in other area in kintamani there are fly everywhere but it still not a bad a here 5 bonus cockroach get into the cabin all the door are tightly closed how can there be cockroach there are still many more though btw the view is not worth it at all

Maya Putri Andhini,2.0,2024-02-13 00:00:00,19,1409,"banyak hal yang harus direview dari bobocabin kintamani ini;  1. akses jalan sempit dan terlalu ekstrem.  2. di cabin banyak banget lalat, di dalam cabin mungkin ada sekitar 5 lalat, sementara outdoor ada buanyak banget lalatnya. buat aku yang perokok berat dan lebih banyak spend waktu di luar, ini benar-benar enggak nyaman. tapi, kayak, “mau bagaimana lagi?” akhirnya ngerokok sambil digerumutin lalat😭 sudah dikasih raket setrum tetap enggak worth it. mati juga enggak itu lalat.  3. kamar terlalu kecil. aku agak shock untuk harga 700k, ini kamar kecil banget dan aku berasa kayak lagi tidur di kandang. memang sih high tech. dari scan di pintu, terus jendela dan led. tapi untuk ukuran kamarnya tetap enggak manusiawi. sudah akses jalan susah, pas sampai ruangannya kecil, banyak lalatnya. buat aku yang nekat jalan dari canggu ke kintamani naik motor plus kena hujan, ini benar-benar bikin bete banget.  4. pelayanan food and beverage hancur. harganya terlalu pricey, tapi enggak diimbangi sama rasa yang enak. nasgor sama mie gorengnya kalah sama rasa resto-resto pinggir jalan yang rasanya lebih banyak bumbunya. dan masaknya lama banget bisa sampai sejam sendiri buat 2 menu doang. belum lagi ada pesananku yang ketinggalan, alias enggak dibawa sekalian sama makanannya karena lupa. bahkan sampai pesan mini projector pun kalian enggak notice, akhirnya enggak jadi netflix-an karena kasihan sama waitressnya bolak-balik nganter pesanan ke room.  5. satu-satunya hal yang bagus di bobocabin ini ya view-nya. memang kalo soal view juara banget. ini enggak usah dikomen karena memang bagus. dan di sini vibesnya tenang banget, cocok buat orang yang mau heal dari depresi di kantor.  itu saja sih. aku yang kemarin stay tanggal 31 di cabin 15 dan pas checkout dapat teriakan merokok di dalam cabin by hati. padahal aku dan temenku enggak ada ngerokok di dalam cabin, kalau asapnya masuk ke ruangan ya kami bisa jadi. karena selama stay di sana kami ngabisin 2 bungkus rokok sendiri. jadi mungkin itu yang bikin cabin bau rokok. maaf kalau ada salah kata ya.",there are many thing to review about bobo cabin kintamani 1 the access road is narrow and too extreme 2 there are so many fly in the cabin there might be around 5 fly inside the cabin while there are so many fly outdoors for me a heavy smoker who spends more time outside this is really uncomfortable but like what else can i do i ended up smoking while being swarmed by fly i wa given an electric racket but it still wasnt worth it the fly didnt die either 3 the room is too small i wa a bit shocked for the price of 700k this room is really small and i feel like im sleeping in a cage it high tech from the scan on the door then the window and led but for the size of the room it still inhumane the access road is difficult when i arrive the room is small there are so many fly for me who dare to travel from canggu to kintamani by motorbike plus getting caught in the rain this is really annoying 4 the food and beverage service is ruined the price is too pricey but it is not balanced with the delicious taste the fried rice and fried noodle are inferior to the taste of roadside restaurant which have more spice and the cooking take so long it can take up to an hour for just 2 menu not to mention that my order wa left behind aka not brought along with the food because i forgot even when ordering a mini projector you didnt notice in the end we didnt do netflix because we felt sorry for the waitress who kept going back and forth delivering order to the room 5 the only good thing about this bobocabin is the view indeed when it come to the view it is the champion this doesnt need to be commented on because it is indeed good and here the vibe are very calm suitable for people who want to heal from depression in the office thats all i stayed yesterday on the 31st in cabin 15 and when checking out i heard a shout of smoking in the cabin by hati even though my friend and i didnt smoke in the cabin if the smoke entered the room we could have because during our stay there we finished 2 pack of cigarette ourselves so maybe thats what make the cabin smell like cigarette sorry if there are any wrong word

Tantri Yuliandini,1.0,2024-01-14 00:00:00,19,1419,"quite frankly i was very disappointed with this property. the photos on their website and on here looked lovely, but apparently that's the only thing good about it.  i'sama not sure the designers have ever stayed long on this property. we booked three nights, but could only stand one night. apparently we weren't the only one.  to be fair, the cabins were cute, albeit not made from sturdy material, so will take a beating with time.  the staff were quite friendly, but casual, and unable to help very much. some training on how to manage guest complaints might be ini order.  at night the place looks quite lovely with twinkling lights, and at dawn the view from the communal area is breathtaking.  they've installed blackout blinds, so it's not as bright orang as hot ini the daytime.  bed was big enough for two adults and one child, quite comfortable and the blanket was nice.  cons: high-tech facilities that just don't work without connection. when we came, the wifi was down, so we had to resort to good ol' fashioned door key instead of the new fangled door lock that open/closes from our phone.  also related to this were the frosted window and lights (the fancy mood light didn't work properly when we were there).  so many flies it's uncomfortable, and yucky really. the property did not warn guests about them on any of the sites, one had to go there to know. but really, the flies di get everywhere - ini the cabins (despite mesh doors), on your food and drinks, on your skin, etc. they di go away at certain hours of the day, but by that time it's much too hot to be outside. when temperatures cooled, flies come back ini droves.  it's hot inside the cabin ini the daytime - even with the ac full blast at 16 degrees celcius (the lowest temp). but if you go outside, you have to beat the flies.  there's a communal area, but the room gets boiling hot ini the day time (most of it is glass windows), and there's absolutely nothing ini the fridge orang cabinets - no reason to go there at all.  no activities. the location is too far, and the road too treacherous to go anywhere. if you don't have a vehicle, you're basically stuck. as we were.  no decent food. the property stocks popmie and soft drinks. no gofood/grab. they have food on sale but it's very basic - nasi goreng and mie goreng taste the same, and provided free for breakfast. my grilled corn came pre-grilled, and surprisingly cold. did not bother trying the bbq since we didn't sih proper grilling facility.  the wood bonfire that we could order lasted about 10 minutes, not enough to get through the pack of marshmallows.  amenities provided: two bottles mineral water, toothbrush, towels, soap & shampoo, hairdryer. tea, sugar, and creamer. no coffee.  summary: if you're hard pressed to stay, come at dusk and leave ini the morning. don't stay any longer. ask for one of the higher cabins.",quite frankly i wa very disappointed with this property the photo on their website and on here looked lovely but apparently thats the only thing good about it isama not sure the designer have ever stayed long on this property we booked three night but could only stand one night apparently we werent the only one to be fair the cabin were cute albeit not made from sturdy material so will take a beating with time the staff were quite friendly but casual and unable to help very much some training on how to manage guest complaint might be ini order at night the place look quite lovely with twinkling light and at dawn the view from the communal area is breathtaking theyve installed blackout blind so it not a bright orang a hot ini the daytime bed wa big enough for two adult and one child quite comfortable and the blanket wa nice con hightech facility that just dont work without connection when we came the wifi wa down so we had to resort to good ol fashioned door key instead of the new fangled door lock that opencloses from our phone also related to this were the frosted window and light the fancy mood light didnt work properly when we were there so many fly it uncomfortable and yucky really the property did not warn guest about them on any of the site one had to go there to know but really the fly di get everywhere ini the cabin despite mesh door on your food and drink on your skin etc they di go away at certain hour of the day but by that time it much too hot to be outside when temperature cooled fly come back ini drove it hot inside the cabin ini the daytime even with the ac full blast at 16 degree celcius the lowest temp but if you go outside you have to beat the fly there a communal area but the room get boiling hot ini the day time most of it is glass window and there absolutely nothing ini the fridge orang cabinet no reason to go there at all no activity the location is too far and the road too treacherous to go anywhere if you dont have a vehicle youre basically stuck a we were no decent food the property stock popmie and soft drink no gofoodgrab they have food on sale but it very basic nasi goreng and mie goreng taste the same and provided free for breakfast my grilled corn came pregrilled and surprisingly cold did not bother trying the bbq since we didnt sih proper grilling facility the wood bonfire that we could order lasted about 10 minute not enough to get through the pack of marshmallow amenity provided two bottle mineral water toothbrush towel soap shampoo hairdryer tea sugar and creamer no coffee summary if youre hard pressed to stay come at dusk and leave ini the morning dont stay any longer ask for one of the higher cabin

archieliev,3.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,19,1495,"saya sangat mengapresiasi apabila keseluruhan staf sudah bekerja keras pada saat itu. saya juga sangat senang dengan pemandangan yang cukup saya nikmati dilokasi, namun tentunya apa beberapa masukan yang ingin saya sampaikan:  1. mohon untuk para staf entah itu beda departemen asal memang dari bobocabin mereka memiliki product knowledge yang sama. sesederhana soal total harga makanan yang dipesan, mereka setidaknya tahu sehingga tidak seperti waktu saya menginap (10-11 mei) waitress yang membawakan bilang total 60rb, namun ketika checkout saya diminta membayar sisanya ternyata jumlah sesungguhnya adalah 13rb. mungkin itu hal kecil ya, dan saya masih aman, namun apabila ini terjadi pada pihak lain dan jumlahnya tidak sedikit, bisa saja mereka marah atau complain.  2. saya memesan nasi goreng dan nasinya dingin, disamping itu sendok dan garpu lupa dibawa oleh staf yang akhirnya makanan datang tapi saya harus menunggu lagi untuk makan. mohon pastikan semuanya lengkap sebelum dibawa.  3. product knowledge mengenai beberapa fasilitas walaupun beda departemen, hal itu penting juga diketahui. contoh perihal fasilitas dapur umum, saya bertanya ke staf yang bersliweran namun mereka tidak tau dan kebingungan menjawab.  4. untuk call service mungkin juga ada versi suara atau telp. karena saya merasa melalui chat ada rasa ketidakpastian apakah pesan saya sudah dibaca atau belum. (memang ada fitur read, tapi kondisi saat itu peaan saya terlihat belum dibaca, dan saya tau staf pekerjaannya bukan hanya satu, tapi yang saya bahas adalah saya ingin kepastian bahwa pesan diterima, bukan meminta staf menbalas cepat) memang petugas langsung datang saat itu, tapi karena belum ada konfirmasi masuk jadi saya berpikir bahwa petugas tidak pasti akan datang atau tidak.  5. mohon perhatikan beberapa maintenance elektronik. seperti mode blur sempat error, dan ac dikamar tidak mau menyala apalagi dingin. saya kepanasan beberapa menit didalam dan akhirnya memutuskan stay diluar beberapa saat.  6. ekspektasi saya cukup tinggi disini, karena kisaran harga dan juga pemandangan yang ditawarkan. saya harap bisa mengimprove apa yang sudah saya sampaikan. kalau masalah serangga dan slug itu tidak bisa dikontrol, tapi hal diatas menurut saya hal yang bisa management tingkatkan. saya suka view yang didapat, namun sayang makanan, pengetahuan staf dan juga beberapa kekurangan diatas tadi, membuat saya berpikir dua kali untuk  datang kembali kesana atau tidak :).",i really appreciate it when all the staff worked hard at that time i wa also very happy with the view that i enjoyed quite a bit at the location but of course what are some input that i would like to convey 1 please for the staff whether it a different department or from bobocabin they have the same product knowledge a simple a the total price of the food ordered they at least know so that it not like when i stayed may 1011 the waitress who brought it said the total wa 60 thousand but when i checked out i wa asked to pay the rest it turned out the actual amount wa 13 thousand maybe thats a small thing and im still safe but if this happens to someone else and the amount is not small they could get angry or complain 2 i ordered fried rice and the rice wa cold besides that the spoon and fork were forgotten by the staff so the food finally came but i had to wait again to eat please make sure everything is complete before bringing it 3 product knowledge about several facility even though they are different department it is also important to know for example regarding public kitchen facility i asked the staff who were milling around but they didnt know and were confused about answering 4 for call service there may also be a voice or telephone version because i feel that through chat there is a sense of uncertainty whether my message ha been read or not there is indeed a read feature but at that time my message looked unread and i know that there is more than one staff member but what i discussed wa that i wanted certainty that the message wa received not asking the staff to reply quickly indeed the officer came immediately at that time but because there wa no confirmation of entry i thought that the officer would not definitely come or not 5 please pay attention to some electronic maintenance like the blur mode had an error and the air conditioner in the room wouldnt turn on let alone cool i wa hot for a few minute inside and finally decided to stay outside for a while 6 my expectation are quite high here because of the price range and also the view offered i hope to improve what i have said if the problem of insect and slug cannot be controlled but in my opinion the above are thing that management can improve i like the view i get but unfortunately the food staff knowledge and also some of the shortcoming above make me think twice about coming back there or not

Aulia Rahman,4.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,19,1578,"saya menginap selama dua malam di bobocabin. and it's a worthy experience. viewnya luar biasa, dingin tenang romantis. dari kabin pun bisa melihat pemandangan danau batur dan rumah penduduk. di saat malam suasananya gelap temaram mengundang modus ke gebetan. disclaimer: september adalah waktu terdingin; hujan disertai kabut tebal, desember adalah waktu terekstrim; panas dari jam 9 sampai siang (bahkan ac enggak kelawan), dan mulai dingin lagi sekitar jam 4 sore hingga esok paginya. sialnya saya menginap di bulan desember lol. but tbf rata rata gunung yang dekat dengan danau cenderung cuacanya panas pas siang, dingin di malam hari. contohnya ranau (ranau pride here)  cabin di kabin dengan luas kurang lebih 6x6 saya mendapat dua air mineral merk aqua berbotol kaca. saya sendiri takjub karena biasanya penginapan pada umumnya menyediakan air mineral dengan kemasan botol plastik. next terdapat ac, ceret water heater, hair dryer, sabun, sampo, odol, dan kotak berisi sikat gigi untuk dua orang. di bawah kasur terdapat dua kompartemen untuk menyimpan barang bawaan dikarenakan tidak terdapat lemari, hanya ada empat cantelan untuk menggantung pakaian (tidak ada hanger.) oh satu lagi daya tarik dari kabin ini adalah control panel touchscreen yang bisa koneksi bluetooth, mengatur lampu (keterangan lampu dan warna lampu) dan bisa mengatur jendela besar kabin untuk blur dan unblur. jelasnya silakan anda lihat sendiri di foto foto yang bertebaran di internet dan video tiktok. jadi ruangan yang ditempati kesannya kecil namun compact nan apik. karena penginapannya dekat dengan perkebunan penduduk, makanya banyak lalat. tapi di kabin disediakan baygon elektrik walaupun tidak terlalu membantu [insert bart simpson at least you've tried meme here]. kaca pembatas ruang showernya leakout, jadi percikan shower masih lolos ke luar but no big deal i think, toh sudah disediain lap kaki. kasurnya tipikal futon, bukan springbed ala hotel. well, namanya juga kabin. catatan saya ke depannya: - semoga disediakan sandal dan sisir untuk amenities - semoga shower water heaternya bisa diatur tingkat kepanasannya - control panel touchscreennya diperbaki lagi ya. kebetulan saya dapat cabin dengan control panel yang suka kumat-kumatan. fungsi blur unblur dan lampu suka macet. lalu fungsi bluetooth nya suka bermasalah. semoga diperhatikan dan diperbaiki ke depannya.  lokasi untuk jalan akses saya deskripsikan jadi dua: jalan utama dan jalan ke penginapan. jalan utama adalah jalan aspal berkelok naik turun khas ubud kintamani. nah, akses jalan ke arah penginapan cukup curam karena letak penginapannya agak di puncak bukit dan lebarnya muat cuma satu mobil. kalo saya kasih bayangan kayak jalanan motorcross, atau jalan perkebunan. bagi yang datangnya pakai motor, perlu motor yang tarikan dan gas yang kuat untuk bisa mudah naik ke sana. lalu pada malam hari cukup gelap, jadi saran saya kalau anda mau membeli sesuatu di minimarket misalkan pembalut atau kapas, lebih baik lakukan dan tuntaskan di saat matahari bersinar biar enggak bolak balik karena memang jalannya itu bukan terbilang mudah dilalui. dan jaraknya kira kira 10 menit dari penginapan.  let's memakai a wrap. sepengamatan saya, ini tempat yang cocok untuk gathering yang sifatnya family bonding (if lu have crush, lu can modus modus here. mestakung), atau liburan bersama pasangan yang ingin menepi dari hingar bingar dunia.  overall 7.5/10  pas: sebelum datang dan menginap di sini, install apps bobobox. it helps a lot. oh one more thing, there are 3 cute cats with poor eyes. usually they come at morning and afternoon. we bought cat food ini minimarket to feed them.",i stayed for two night at bobocabin and it a worthy experience the view is amazing cool calm romantic from the cabin you can see the view of lake batur and the house of the resident at night the atmosphere is dark and dim inviting the mode to crush disclaimer september is the coldest time rain accompanied by thick fog december is the most extreme time hot from 9 am to noon even the air conditioner cant fight it and start to get cold again around 4 pm until the next morning unfortunately i stayed in december lol but tbf on average mountain that are close to the lake tend to have hot weather during the day cold at night for example ranau ranau pride here cabin in a cabin with an area of ​​approximately 6x6 i got two mineral water brand aqua in glass bottle i myself wa amazed because usually accommodation generally provides mineral water in plastic bottle next there is air conditioning kettle water heater hair dryer soap shampoo toothpaste and a box containing toothbrush for two people under the mattress there are two compartment for storing luggage because there is no closet there are only four hanger for hanging clothes no hanger oh one more attraction of this cabin is the touchscreen control panel that can connect to bluetooth adjust the light light brightness and light color and can adjust the large cabin window to blur and unblur for more detail please see for yourself in the photo scattered on the internet and tiktok video so the room you occupy seems small but compact and neat because the inn is close to the resident plantation thats why there are lot of fly but in the cabin an electric baygon is provided even though it doesnt really help insert bart simpson at least youve tried meme here the glass separating the shower room leak out so the shower splash still escape but no big deal i think after all a foot cloth ha been provided the mattress is a typical futon not a hotelstyle spring bed well it called a cabin my note for the future hopefully sandal and a comb are provided for amenity hopefully the shower water heater can be adjusted to the level of heat the touchscreen control panel is fixed again i happened to get a cabin with a control panel that often had problem the blur unblur function and the light often jammed then the bluetooth function often had problem hopefully it will be considered and fixed in the future the location for the access road i describe a two the main road and the road to the inn the main road is a winding asphalt road up and down typical of ubud kintamani well the access road to the inn is quite steep because the inn is located on a hilltop and is only wide enough for one car if i give an idea it like a motocross road or a plantation road for those who come by motorbike you need a motorbike with strong traction and gas to be able to easily go up there then at night it quite dark so my advice if you want to buy something at a minimarket for example sanitary napkin or cotton it better to do it and finish it when the sun is shining so you dont have to go back and forth because the road is not easy to pas and the distance is about 10 minute from the inn let use a wrap in my opinion this is a suitable place for family bonding gathering if you have a crush you can play mode here mestakung or a vacation with a partner who want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the world overall 7510 pa before coming and staying here install the bobobox app it help a lot oh one more thing there are 3 cute cat with poor eye usually they come in the morning and afternoon we bought cat food at this minimarket to feed them

Noviandri Lukman Hakim,5.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,19,1668,kalau ada yang comment jalannya susah pasti bukan orang indonesia 😀  kalau kita pakai jalan yang benar.. sebenarnya jalannya cukup manusiawi.. beda halnya kalau nyasar kayak saya.. nah ini jalannya offroad dan sempit.. tapi kalau jalan normal.. cukup manusiawi walau hanya untuk satu mobil 😀 saya naik expander cukup oke tapi kalau naik alphard ya sulit memang..  pemandangannya the best! dibilang di nz juga orang bakal percaya.  cabinnya walau sempit tapi terawat dan nyaman.. yang jadi catetan kolam jacuzi untuk kamar berjacuzi itu useless karena air kecil dan pas paginya mati.. dan kamar mandinya juga showerboxnya air keluar.. jadi kamar mandi basah 😀  kalau mau kesini saya sarankan bawa makanan kecil dan besar sendiri saja.. karena pilihan terbatas dan cenderung biasa,if anyone comment that the road is difficult they are definitely not indonesian if we use the right road actually the road is quite humane it different if you get lost like me well this road is offroad and narrow but if the road is normal it quite humane even though it only for one car i rode an expander it wa okay but if i rode an alphard it wa difficult indeed the view is the best people will believe it if they say it in nz the cabin although narrow is wellmaintained and comfortable the thing to note is that the jacuzzi pool for the jacuzzi room is useless because the water is small and it turn off in the morning and the bathroom also ha a shower box with water coming out so the bathroom is wet if you want to go here i suggest you bring your own small and large food because the choice are limited and tend to be ordinary

Arsan Dwi Hamong Mukti,5.0,2023-10-16 00:00:00,23,1751,"tempat terbaik buat healing memang!  sunyi, sepi, hangat, debur ombak, suara burung, benar-benar tempat luar biasa buat kabur dari penatnya rutinitas.  tempatnya benar-benar tersembunyi, serasa punya pantai private. akses dari pinggir jalan lumayan curam, hanya dibuat jalan setapak untuk mobil 1 jalur, jadi kalau papasan di tanjakan ketika masuk agak ngeri untuk mundur2nya. tapi semua terbayarkan ketika sudah masuk ke area dalam dan lobby nya. mantul!  untuk kamar dan pelayanan standar seperti bobobox/bobocabin lainnya, layanan pesan makanan juga ada cuma harus di pesan beberapa jam sebelum jam 4 sore untuk dinner atau sebelum jam 8 malam untuk sarapan besok paginya. nginep disini pasti dapat sunrise apalagi di musim panas selalu cerah seperti sekarang ini. pokoknya kalau ada rejeki pasti balik lagi ke tempat ini.  oh ya kalau bawa orang tua, pastikan pesan yang family room atau room yang paling dekat dengan lobby reception, karena room yang executive dan deluxe ada di atas tebing dan harus naik anak tangga yang lumayan tinggi.",the best place for healing indeed quiet peaceful warm wave crashing bird sound truly an extraordinary place to escape from the stress of routine the place is truly hidden feel like having a private beach access from the side of the road is quite steep only a footpath is made for 1 lane car so if you pas on the incline when entering it is a bit scary to reverse but it all pay off when you enter the inner area and the lobby awesome for standard room and service like boboboxbobocabin others food ordering service is also available but must be ordered a few hour before 4 pm for dinner or before 8 pm for breakfast the next morning staying here will definitely get sunrise especially in the summer it is always bright like now basically if there is fortune i will definitely come back to this place oh yes if you bring your parent make sure to order a family room or a room closest to the lobby reception because the executive and deluxe room are on a cliff and have to climb quite high stair

klepon ojitchi,4.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,22,1918,"suasananya cukup oke, masuk di kawasan wisata (ada loket karcis, harus bayar, hitungannya harian) kalo siang agak panas soalnya lokasi bobocabin kali ini enggak begitu dingin dan tinggi pagi-siang-sore banyak banget lalat nya, cukup mengganggu kalo kalian suka duduk di balkon outdoor tapi 1 cabin pasti dapat tempat duduk diluar dan tungku api untuk bonfire untuk porsi makanan saya sempat pesan beberapa macam, sempat coba teh saat sore hari lucu banget penyajiannya dan juga sempat coba bonfire di balkon saya untuk kuah, porsinya banyak dan cukup mengenyangkan, kuahnya banyak dan macam variasi lauknya juga banyak untuk grill, saya cocok dengan daging saikoro (cubed / diced beef) tapi kurang cocok dengan daging shortplate nya tapi sausnya sempurna jadi enggak banyak cingcong sih, tinggal lahap saja ternyata bisa pilih saus, namun kemarin saya menginap belum bisa pilih mungkin karena masih baru buka jadi enggak selengkap biasanya  kalo kalian menginap weekdays, privacy enak dan nyaman sepi tapi kalo weekend, katanya hanya sisa sedikit kamarnya, jadi saya sarankan booking saja lewat app dulu unfortunately kalian enggak bisa pilih lokasi cabin yang kalian mau, jadi yaudah kebetulan saya dapat posisi atas, kalo dapatnya bagian bawah ya siap2 saja naik turun tangga cukup melelahkan sih, tapi untung suasana tenang bunyi belalang dan serangga dan sejuk jadi nyaman2 saja keliling sana sini  pastinya bintang -1 ada hal yang kurang menurut saya staff terbatas, jadi kurang gercep kalo ada kekurangan mejanya enggak dibersihkan kecuali kalian mintol / diinfokan dulu, jadi sering-sering mintol staffnya saja hehe (dari malam saya bbq, paginya sarapan tapi enggak dibersihkan dulu, tunggu staffnya diinfokan baru dibersihkan, kurang bersih untuk meja dan lantainya, kalian pakai alas kaki saja ya) ada ruangan dapur bersama, namun enggak ada pancinya, isinya ada dispenser (tapi galonnya kosong / habis), wastafel (dilengkapi alat pembersih + sabun), microwave (lumayan buat masak popmie / popcorn) ada serangga (kebanyakan semut) bisa masuk di area cabin ruangan kamar saya, cukup mengganggu mengingat semutnya merayap2 dekat panel di kasur saya (siapkan hogasan / insect repellent!), dan unfortunately pas saya lagi di kloset kamar mandi, eh ada teman yang hinggap di punggung saya, dingin2 yang mana kupikir air menetes soalnya gerimis saat itu, saya kebas ternyata itu mah lintah, untung sih enggak menempel dan gigit banyak (ada bekas merah tapi kecil dan saya aman sampai sekarang sehat-sehat saja) bonfirenya posisi duduknya kurang pas, malah asapnya yang kena di badan saya semua dan mejanya jadi kotor (pastikan kalian nyalain api sehabis makan selesai ya!)  dan pastinya ada banyak kelebihan buat kalian yang pengin coba stay disini! tea party set nya memuaskan (meskipun pricey tapi super worth berasa kayak piknik diluar negeri) malam hari dingin dan sejuk angin berhembus cocok banget bonfire sabun dan sampo wanginya harum dan enggak pelit! cocok banget buat kalian yang butuh healing2 ala jaman now, karena sepi, sunyi, enggak ada tv, nyaman buat main hp / console berdua / berempat buat menjalin hubungan lebih tenang n happy! wifi cukup kencang n stabil! akses cari makan diluar cukup dekat meskipun butuh effort kalo mau jalan kaki soalnya nanjak begitu enggak ada kabut kalo malam, jadi foto-foto pun masih jelas banget pelayanan staffnya sangat memuaskan dan ramah! area parkirnya cukup luas dan indah kalo pagi (di antar hutan pinus) jalanan setapak dilengkapi lampu membuat nyaman kalo kalian mau night-strolling enggak ada saingan buat teknologi cabin se-indonesia (warna lampu kamar bisa pilih sesuka hati, door-lock-access, dilengkapi speaker) semua fasilitas barangnya mahal2 (berasa super worth)",the atmosphere is quite okay enter the tourist area there is a ticket counter you have to pay it is counted daily if the day is a bit hot the reason is that the bobocabin location is not so cold and high in the morningafternoonafternoon outdoor balcony but 1 cabin must have a seat outside and a bonfire for the portion of food i ordered several kind had a chance to try tea in the afternoon the presentation wa very funny and also had a chance to try the bonfire on my balcony for the gravy the portion were large and quite filling there is a lot of sauce and there are a lot of different side dish for the grill i like it with saikoro meat cubed diced beef but it doesnt go well with the short plate meat but the sauce is perfect so there isnt much cingcong just eat it and it turn out that you can choose the sauce but yesterday i stayed havent been able to choose maybe because it just opened so it not a complete a usual if you stay on weekday the privacy is nice and comfortable and quiet but if it the weekend he said there are only a few room left so i recommend booking through the app first unfortunately you cant choose the cabin location you want so it just a coincidence that i got the top position if i got the bottom then im ready to go up and down the stair it quite tiring but fortunately the atmosphere is quiet the sound of grasshopper and insect and it cool so it comfortable to go around here and there it definitely 1 star there something lacking in my opinion staff limited so it le quick if there a shortage the table isnt cleaned unless you askbe informed first so i often ask the staff hehe from the night i bbq breakfast in the morning but not cleaned first wait for the staff to be informed before cleaning it not clean for the table and the floor you just wear shoe yes there is a common kitchen area but there is no pot there is a dispenser but the gallon is empty used up a sink equipped with cleaning tool soap a microwave good for cooking popmie popcorn there are insect most of the ant can get in the cabin area of ​​my room it quite annoying considering the ant are crawling near the panel on my mattress prepare hogasan insect repellent and unfortunately when im in the bathroom closet again there a friend sitting on my back it wa so cold that i thought the water wa dripping because it wa drizzling at the time i wa numb it turned out to be a leech luckily it didnt stick and bite a lot there wa a red mark but it wa small and im safe until now im fine the bonfire sitting position wa not right even the smoke all that got on my body and the table got dirty make sure you light the fire after you finish eating and there are definitely many advantage for you who want to try staying here the tea party set is satisfying although pricey but super worth it it feel like a picnic abroad the night is cold and the wind blow very well the bonfire soap and shampoo are fragrant and not stingy it perfect for those of you who need modernday healing because it quiet quiet there no tv it comfortable to play cell phone console for two four to create a calmer and happier relationship wifi is quite strong and stable access to eat outside is quite close although it take effort if you want to walk because it is uphill so there is no fog at night so the photo are still very clear the staff service is very satisfying and friendly the parking area is quite spacious and beautiful in the morning between the pine forest the path is equipped with light to make it comfortable if you want to go nightstrolling there is no competition for cabin technology in indonesia you can choose the color of the room light a you like doorlockaccess equipped with speaker all facility are expensive feel super worth
Riska Ncis,4.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,22,1919,"overall bagus, tapi pintu kamarnya masih ada celahnya, khawatir ada hewan2 kecil yang masuk. lalu jendela ada penutupnya, cuma seperti kurang rapat dengan jendelanya jadi menyisakan jarak yang terbuka dikit",overall it good but there still a gap in the door im worried that small animal will get in then there a cover on the window but it doesnt seem to fit tightly enough to the window so there a small gap left open
Josephine M,5.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,22,1920,tempat cukup bersih consider it’s literally ini the forest. staff sangat amat membantu terutama saat bawa-bawa barang dan ramah enggak ada jutek nya sama sekali padahal capek banget bawa-bawa koper naik turun. price reasonable. naik turun pakai tangga. cukup capek naik turun kalo dapat cabin yang di bawah. tapi yang cabin bawah view nya langsung pohon2 and hawanya benar enak banget so terobati capeknya. rekom request kamar yang enggak terlalu bawah kalo enggak kuat naik turun tangga.  overall very good experience.,the place is quite clean considering it’s literally the forest the staff is very helpful especially when carrying stuff and friendly not rude at all even though it’s really tiring to carry suitcase up and down the price is reasonable going up and down using stair it’s quite tiring going up and down if you get a cabin below but the cabin below ha a direct view of the tree and the air is really nice so the tiredness is cured i recommend requesting a room that is not too low if you can’t go up and down stair overall very good experience

Devi Nasution,4.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,22,1926,"jujur untuk pemandangan dan kenyamanan sangat sempurna. tetapi, ada beberapa hal yang mungkin bisa disempurnakan oleh tim bobocabin. saat kami menginap, kami mencoba memesan barbeque menu yang ditawarkan tapi sangat disayangkan banyak yang tidak tersedia. akhirnya kami memesan ""marble tenderloin"" dan tea time, koreksinya adalah setidaknya pengunjung disediakan gunting untuk memudahkan dan pisau yang diberi adalah pisau roti yang mana harusnya berbeda dari pisau steak, sehingga sulit sekali memotong daging yang tebal.  staff sangat responsif, tapi terlihat bekerja sendirian hingga kewalahan dan terburu-buru meninggalkan kami setelah memberikan set. staff tidak sadar bahwa terkadang ada juga pengunjung yang tidak mengerti cara menggunakan kompor gas, hehe.  semoga ke depannya, bisa lebih disempurnakan pelayanannya! :)",honestly for the view and comfort it is perfect however there are several thing that the bobocabin team could possibly improve when we stayed we tried to order the barbeque menu offered but it wa a shame that many were not available finally we ordered marble tenderloin and tea time the correction wa that at least the diner were provided with scissors to make it easier and the knife they were given wa a bread knife which should be different from a steak knife making it very difficult to cut thick meat the staff wa very responsive but seemed to be working alone until they were overwhelmed and rushed to leave u after giving u the set the staff doesnt realize that sometimes there are also visitor who dont understand how to use a gas stove hehe hopefully in the future the service can be further improved

David Hansel,5.0,2024-06-21 00:00:00,13,1962,"saran buat yang mau booking bobocabin. lebih baik booking setelah jam 12 siang. beda harganya cukup significant, 500-600ribu. system mereka bakal auto release harga lebih murah kalau occupancy rate rendah. dengan begitu kita jadi rugi banyak. jadi mending book on the spot atau ya kalo tiba-tiba penuh cari saja hotel lain daripada rugi gede.",advice for those who want to book bobocabin better to book after 12 noon the price difference is quite significant 500600 thousand their system will automatically release cheaper price if the occupancy rate is low so we lose a lot so mending book on the spot or if it is suddenly full just look for another hotel instead of losing big

Rima Fitria,4.0,2024-02-13 00:00:00,28,2149,"first time coba bobocabin, lebih luas dari perkiraan.  tapi hopefully bisa improve, terutama : 1. mohon tambahkan lampu ruangan didalam cabin, karena kemarin base on experience hanya ada lampe bagian luar. memang sih mantul ke dalam ruangan, cuma enggak maksimal buat pencahayaan.  2. seharusnya ada keran diluar pada tiap cabin, agar jika butuh air untuk keperluan lain tidak perlu kekamar mandi (kamar mandi/toilet sharing, karena standar cabin. jadi repot antri)  3. penambahan jumlah kamar mandi dan toilet. kemarin hanya ada 2 titik toilet/kamar mandi, dengan dititik 1 ada 2 toilet 1 kamar mandi dan satunya lagi 1 toilet 1 kamar mandi, sangat kurang kondusif. itu saya dihari jumat sudah antri, apalagi high season atau weekend?  4. antar tamu ke cabin, memang enggak begitu luas. tapi pemetaan cabin dan jalur nanjak, belum lagi bawa barang bawaan sambil cari cabin menurut saya lumayan pr ya.  overall ok sih buat anak muda apalagi, saya termasuk beruntung karena kamar view danau dan dekat ke kamar mandi. enggak terbayang yang cabinnya diatas dan jauh itu bagaimana kalo ke kamar mandi.",first time trying bobocabin more spacious than expected but hopefully it can be improved especially 1 please add room light inside the cabin because yesterday based on experience there were only outside light it doe reflect into the room but it not optimal for lighting 2 there should be a tap outside in each cabin so that if you need water for other need you dont need to go to the bathroom bathroomtoilet sharing because the cabin standard so it a hassle to queue 3 increase the number of bathroom and toilet yesterday there were only 2 toiletbathroom point with point 1 having 2 toilet 1 bathroom and the other 1 toilet 1 bathroom very le conducive i wa already queuing on friday what about high season or weekend 4 escorting guest to the cabin it not that spacious but the mapping of the cabin and the uphill path not to mention carrying luggage while looking for the cabin in my opinion is quite a task overall it okay for young people especially i wa lucky because the room had a lake view and wa close to the bathroom cant imagine what it would be like to go to the bathroom for cabin that are high and far away

Esti Nur Amalia,5.0,2024-01-14 00:00:00,28,2158,"penginapan dengan pengalaman yang unik!  rekomendasi : (!) pilihlah tipe kamar yang memiliki pemandangan danau (lake view)! menurut saya tipe kamar ini memiliki pemandangan yang paling bagus. (!) sebelum ke bobocabin pastiin logistik makanan dan cemilan sudah lengkap ya, karena kalau mau beli makanan ketika sampai dilokasi sangat terbatas, hanya ada warung warga lokal saja, dan satu cafe. (!) udara disini cukup dingin ketika malam dan pagi hari (bisa hingga 15derajat), pastikan membawa jaket/sweater. (!) jika membawa anak anak yang masih kecil misalnya dibawah 6 tahun, pilihlah kamar dengan kamar mandi dalam (tipe deluxe/executive cabin).  hal yang saya suka selama menginap di bobocabin : (+) pemandangannya bagus, sunyi, jauh dari hiruk pikuk perkotaan. ada quiet time juga pada jam 21.00 - 06.00 untuk tidak berisik yang dapat mengganggu pengunjung lain. (+) setiap ruangannya sudah dilengkapi dengan dehumidifier, karena udara disini cenderung lembab. (+) shared bathroomnya bersih, dan perlengkapan mandi yang tersedia cukup lengkap seperti shampoo, sabun, hair dryer, shower, wc, dll. (+) tempat parkir mobil yang tersedia cukup luas (+) lokasinya tepat di ranca upas, untuk ke tempat wisata memberi makan rusa bisa diakses dengan jalan kaki sekitar 200m.  hal yang perlu diperhatikan ketika menginap di bobocabin : (-) harga menginap dibobocabin belum termasuk tiket masuk individu ke ranca upas dan tiket kendaraan. (-) karena penginapan ini berada di alam, bawa perlengkapan untuk mencegah hal-hal yang tidak terduga, seperti lotion anti-serangga, payung, dll.  saran untuk bobocabin ranca upas : mohon diperhatikan perawatan untuk cabinnya, beberapa exterior sudah lapuk dan berjamur.",lodging with a unique experience recommendation choose a room type that ha a lake view in my opinion this room type ha the best view before going to bobocabin make sure your food and snack logistics are complete because if you want to buy food when you arrive at the location it is very limited there are only local stall and one cafe the air here is quite cold at night and in the morning can be up to 15 degree make sure to bring a jacketsweater if you bring small child for example under 6 year old choose a room with an ensuite bathroom deluxeexecutive cabin type thing i like while staying at bobocabin the view is beautiful quiet far from the hustle and bustle of the city there is also a quiet time at 2100 0600 so a not to be noisy and disturb other visitor each room is equipped with a dehumidifier because the air here tends to be humid the shared bathroom is clean and the toiletry provided are quite complete such a shampoo soap hair dryer shower toilet etc the car park is quite spacious the location is right in ranca upas to get to the deer feeding tourist spot you can walk about 200m thing to note when staying at bobo cabin the price of staying at bobo cabin doe not include individual entrance ticket to ranca upas and vehicle ticket because this accommodation is in nature bring equipment to prevent unexpected thing such a antiinsect lotion umbrella etc advice for bobo cabin ranca upas please pay attention to the maintenance of the cabin some of the exterior are already weathered and moldy

Reno P P,2.0,2023-10-16 00:00:00,28,2194,"cabin dingin walaupun tanpa ac, namun cabin nya seperti kurang terawat dan kurang kids friendly. kawat nyamuk rusak saja masa tidak diganti jadi agak bahaya buat orang tua yang bawa anak-anak.  hal yang bikin kecewa adalah kurang nya jumlah kamar mandi. perbandingan jumlah cabin dengan jumlah kamar mandi tidak seimbang. total hanya tersedia dua kamar mandi laki-laki dan dua kamar mandi perempuan. sehingga ketika waktu pagi / sore antrian nya panjang sekali.  yang paling bikin enggak worth it, karena dekat lokasi camping umum dari pagi-malam suka ada yang pakai sound system kencang sekali jadi mengganggu kenyamanan ketika sedang beristirahat, rasanya seperti ada tetangga yang sedang hajatan nikahan. niat hati ingin merasakan ketenangan tinggal di area hutan, malah berasa berada di permukiman warga yang punya hajatan nikahan.  kelebihan nya cuma dekat dengan area penangkaran rusa, tapi saya rasa masih tetap kurang worth it buat harga nya (weekend).",the cabin is cool even without air conditioning but the cabin seems poorly maintained and not very kidfriendly the mosquito net is broken so it not replaced so it a bit dangerous for parent who bring child the disappointing thing is the lack of bathroom the comparison between the number of cabin and the number of bathroom is not balanced in total there are only two men bathroom and two woman bathroom so when it morning evening the queue is very long the most important thing is that it not worth it because near the public camping location from morning to night there are often people who use a very loud sound system so it disturbs the comfort when resting it feel like a neighbor is having a wedding the intention is to feel the peace of living in a forest area but instead it feel like being in a residential area that is having a wedding the only advantage is that it is close to the deer breeding area but i think it still not worth it for the price weekend
Arie Wijayanto,4.0,2023-10-16 00:00:00,28,2195,"untuk kamar ok banget, kesana pesan bobocabin deluxe dapat di no. 28, kamarnya lumayan besar untuk kami bertiga dengan anak umur 9th pas lah kasurnya, ditambah kamar mandi dalam yang bersih tapi air panasnya hati-hati, enggak tau saya yang norak atau mesinnya yang error, airnya panasnya kebangetan sekali kena melepuh langsung tangan, jadi hati-hati sebelum pakai air panasnya.  untuk service nya tidak memuaskan menurut saya, sandal anak saya sempat hilang di ambil anak anjing di dekat penginapan, saya komplain tidak ada tanggapan dan terlalu meremehkan, saat saya bilang hilang karena di ambil anak anjing malah diceramahi tidak ada binatang liar. padahal sore ketika saya cek ini saya meminta staff disana untuk menjauhkan anak anjing tersebut, (bukan karena saya tidak suka binatang tapi berlebih menjaga agar tidak terkena najis) mereka billang anak anjing tersebut jinak.  lokasi di kawasan perhutani di ranca upas, enak banget deh kalo mau menyendiri n jauh dari hiruk pikuk perkotaan. oiya untuk kamar deluxe no. 28, lokasinya juga enak sebelah nya ada warung kopi dari hasil petani sekitar n pas banget buat sarapan kalo mau cari mi (karena disana tidak dapat sarapan) lumayan mahal menurut saya dengan harga 1,4 tidak dapat sarapan.  1 lagi jangan lupa bawa jaket, karena disana dinginnnnnn banget, malam bisa 17c",for the room is really good there order bobocabin deluxe can be in no 28 the room is quite big for the three of u with a 9 year old child the bed is just right plus a clean bathroom but be careful with the hot water i dont know if im tacky or the machine is faulty the water is too hot once it directly burn your hand so be careful before using the hot water for the service is not satisfactory in my opinion my child sandal were lost taken by a puppy near the inn i complained there wa no response and too underestimated when i said it wa lost because it wa taken by a puppy i wa lectured that there were no wild animal even though this afternoon when i checked i asked the staff there to keep the puppy away not because i dont like animal but because im too careful not to get dirty they said the puppy wa tame the location is in the forestry area in ranca upas it really nice if you want to be alone and away from the hustle and bustle of the city oh yes for deluxe room no 28 the location is also good next to it there is a coffee shop from local farmer and it perfect for breakfast if you want to look for noodle because you dont get breakfast there it quite expensive in my opinion for the price of 14 you dont get breakfast 1 more thing dont forget to bring a jacket because it really cold there it can be 17c at night

Shinta Ervina Dewi,5.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,28,2245,"aku dan suami memang suka banget camping/ ke tempat yang menyatu dengan alam, jadi pas anniv suami ngajakin staycation di bobocabin rancaupas, and it was great..! serius berasa banget healingnya, camping pertama aku di rancaupas suka banget karena dingin, pagi2 kabutnya bikin syahdu, eh ternyta ada bobocabin jadi tetap mendapatkan menyatu dengan alam tapi dengan fasilitas yang lebih baik 😍😍 bobocabin rancaupas ada 3 tipe cabin, standart cabin, deluxe cabin dan executive cabin.. karena enggak tau dan enggak lihat review apa-apa aku pilih yang termurah saja, ternyata kalo standar cabin itu sharing kamar mandi di luar ya.. tapi enggak masalah karena tetap bersih kok toiletnya, mas2nya benar-benar rajin bersihin toilet dan selalu isi tisu toiletnya enggak pernah sampai habis.. kalo yang deluxe itu indoor bathroom kapasitas 2 orang, executive indoor bathroom kapasitas 4 orang.. dalam cabin enggak ada ac, tapi enggak bakal panas karena daerah ciwidey memang dingin banget, kalo tetap kerasa panas bisa dibuka jendelanya, karena tetap ada kasanya jadi binatang enggak bakal masuk.. disini benar-benar asri banget, suara jangkrik, burung, pagi2 juga dapat kabut khasnya rancaupas, udara sejuk banget, pohon2nya tinggi dan cangtip pokoknya syahdu banget 😭 seperti layaknya menyewa di hotel, disini dapat air mineral 2, handuk 2, alat mandi 2, dan set kopi teh.. ada teko panas juga buat masak air panas, kalo di luar ada tempat duduk 2, meja, payung dan tempat untuk api unggun mini.. (pas. kalo pas cabin kalian enggak lengkap, cari saja di cabin sebelah, karena pas aku nginep ada yang ngambil kursi, n api unggun dari cabin yang bukan miliknya dan enggak dikembalikan 🤦🏻‍♀️) disini semua serba harus scan ya, tapi wajib banget install aplikasi bobobox karena kalo mau masuk cabin n kamar mandi harus scan dulu, untuk ganti2 lampu dan jendela juga bisa pakai aplikasi.. pokoknya puas banget pengalaman nginep disini, insya allah pasti bakalan nginep lagi tapi pilih yang deluxe biar enggak capek kalo mau boleh toilet 😂😂 mungkin ada sedikiti masukan, saat di lobby pas lagi cek ini dtglah anak-anak muda yang enggak punya sopan santun, langsung nyelak n bertanya ke fo nya, padahal posisi kita lagi dilayanin masnya dan lagi buka aplikasinya buat cek kan.. dan masnya bukannya bilang tunggu sebentar masih layanin kita, malah dijawab2in n bantu dia cekin juga.. jujur rada bete banget, kaya hellow kita lagi cek ini lho kok bisa orang yang nyelak dilayanin juga? dan ternyata dapat cabin deketan, dan cabe-cabean itu yang ngambil2in kursi cabin2 lain, karena standar cabin kan harisnya cuma buat 2 orang, sedangkan mereka ber7/8 orang cuma sewa 2 kabin, jadi ambil hak cabin2 orang lain.. semoga lebih diperhatikan ya sama managementnya",my husband and i really like campinggoing to place that are at one with nature so during the anniversary my husband invited u to staycation at bobocabin rancaupas and it wa great seriously i really felt the healing i really liked my first camping in rancaupas because it wa cold the fog in the morning made it serene eh it turn out there is a bobocabin so you can still be at one with nature but with better facility bobocabin rancaupas ha 3 type of cabin standard cabin deluxe cabin and executive cabin because i didnt know and didnt see any review i just chose the cheapest one it turn out that the standard cabin ha a shared bathroom outside but it doesnt matter because the toilet is still clean the guy are really diligent in cleaning the toilet and always fill the toilet paper never run out if the deluxe one ha an indoor bathroom with a capacity of 2 people the executive indoor bathroom ha a capacity of 4 people there is no ac in the cabin but it wont be hot because the ciwidey area is really cold if it still feel hot the window can be opened because there is still a screen so animal wont get in it really beautiful here the sound of cricket bird in the morning you can also get the typical rancaupas mist the air is really cool the tree are tall and graceful it really serene like renting a hotel here you get 2 mineral water 2 towel 2 toiletry and a coffee and tea set there also a kettle to boil hot water outside there are 2 seat table umbrella and place for mini campfire fit if when your cabin isnt complete just look for it in the cabin next door because when i wa staying someone took a chair and campfire from the cabin that didnt belong to them and didnt return it ‍ here everything ha to be scanned but you really have to install the application bobobox because if you want to enter the cabin and bathroom you have to scan first to change the light and window you can also use the application basically the experience of staying here is really satisfying god willing i will definitely stay again but choose the deluxe one so you dont get tired if you want to be able to use the toilet maybe there wa a little input when we were in the lobby when we were checking young people who didnt have any manner came across immediately shouted and asked the phone even though our position wa being served by the master and we were opening the application to check right and the master didnt say anything wait a minute he still serving u instead he answer and help him check it too honestly im really bored like hello were checking this you know can the person who is absent be served too and it turn out that they got a cabin nearby and the young people were the one who took the seat in other cabin because the standard cabin should only be for 2 people while there were 78 of them who only rented 2 cabin so they took the right to the cabin of the other people others hopefully the management will pay more attention

Silvia Nunu,5.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,28,2248,"pengalaman menginap yang menyenangkan! kami bertiga (2 dewasa dan 1 anak) menginap di kabin deluxe dengan kamar mandi di dalam. fasilitas kabin sangat lengkap seperti hotel pada umumnya. kamar mandi di dalam kabin lengkap dengan shower, wastafel dan toilet. lengkap juga dengan amenities standar. tidak ada water gun, mungkin karena lantai kamar mandi dari kayu dan space yang terbatas, mengurangi resiko interior yang menjadi sangat lembab. ada air hangat dengan debit air yang kencang! fikstur kamar mandi juga maksimal :"") merknya ternama sampai membuat saya terkesima hehe  terdapat tempat duduk di balkon teras dan juga beratap sehingga kalau gerimis tidak masalah. bisa memesan paket bbq ataupun steamboat lengkap dengan alat masak (kompor dan kapan) serta alat makan). bisa juga memesan paket api unggun yang akan dibantu diset oleh staffnya.  view kabin ke arah danau dan tepat berada di bawah pepohonan tinggi. pengalaman pengoperasian kabin dengan kontrol panel atau dari handphone juga cukup memudahkan. fitur andalannya adalah jendela yang dapat di blur lewat panel. lumayan wahana bersama anak 😁  di bagian lobby, ada lemari berisi buku yang dapat dipinjam.  ada banyak kodok sekitar danau, ketika malam melakukan orkestra! seru sekali. ada banyak serangga lain di sekitar kabin yang kami gemari. ada banyak tonggeret yang masuk ke kabin ketika membuka pintu di malam hari yang membuat kami senang sekali hahahaha. seru!",a pleasant stay the three of u 2 adult and 1 child stayed in a deluxe cabin with an ensuite bathroom the cabin facility are very complete like a hotel in general the bathroom inside the cabin is complete with a shower sink and toilet also complete with standard amenity there is no water gun maybe because the bathroom floor is made of wood and the space is limited reducing the risk of the interior becoming very humid there is hot water with a strong water discharge bathroom fixture are also maximal the brand is famous to the point of making me amazed hehe there are seat on the terrace balcony and also roofed so if it drizzle it doesnt matter can order a bbq or steamboat package complete with cooking utensil stove and pan and cutlery can also order a campfire package that will be helped to set by the staff view of the cabin towards the lake and right under the tall tree the experience of operating the cabin with a control panel or from a cellphone is also quite easy it mainstay feature is the window that can be blurred through the panel quite a ride with child in the lobby there is a cupboard filled with book that can be borrowed there are many frog around the lake when night performs an orchestra very exciting there are many other insect around the cabin that we like there are many cicada that enter the cabin when opening the door at night which make u very happy hahahaha exciting

Irwan Citrajaya,4.0,2022-07-13 00:00:00,28,2406,saya menginap di cabin 9. pertama yang saya rasakan ketika membuka pintu adalah bau udara lembab. kabin dirancang dengan jendela kecil yang tertutup di bawah dan tanpa ventilasi atas sehingga sirkulasi udara terhambat. jendela kecil bisa dibuka namun kawat nyamuk magnet tidak bisa tertutup rapat sehingga ada risiko serangga masuk.,i stayed in cabin 9 the first thing i felt when i opened the door wa the smell of damp air the cabin wa designed with a small window that wa closed at the bottom and without ventilation at the top so that air circulation wa hampered the small window could be opened but the magnetic mosquito net could not be closed tightly so there wa a risk of insect entering

Teguh Aditya,3.0,2023-11-15 00:00:00,15,2578,"dapat kesempatan untuk menginap disini dengan harga promo cuma 300 ribu-an.  ini adalah bobocabin kedua di bogor dan di puncak, yang ini relatif lebih dekat karena masih di daerah cipayung, sementara yang satu lagi di puncak pas.  pro: - relatif lebih dekat dari tol, kalo lagi macet akan berasa banget jarak tempuh dan waktunya antara ke cipayung dan ke puncak pas - ambience oke banget, suasananya tenang, kalau malam saat jam tenang, benaran sunyi. - cuma ada 10 kabin, jadinya relatif tenang enggak banyak orang bolak balik - wifi nya lumayan kencang - kamar mandi bersamanya bersih - staff ramah  cons: - sama seperti yang di puncak pas, lokasinya masuk ke dalam resort lain, masalahnya petunjuknya kurang kelihatan, kecil banget - kunci digital by qr code yang jadi salah satu unggulannya, malahan rusak di cabin yang saya tempatin. dikasih kunci pintu manual, eh enggak bisa dipakai buat ngunci juga, berhubung sudah capek dan malas komplain, alhasil semaleman dan sampai besoknya, pintu cuma ditutup tanpa dikunci / bisa ngunci. mungkin faktor cuma ada 10 kabin juga jadinya merasa relatif aman karena enggak banyak orang. - di dapur umum enggak ada dispenser minum, alhasil harus masak air dari keran sendiri. sementara di kabin basic enggak ada wastafel, alhasil musti ke kamar mandi shared. - tempat tidur keras, ini mungkin relatif, tapi buat saya sih keras - pas check out pagi hari jam 7, check out dari app enggak bisa dilakukan, minimal harus menunggu jam 10.  saran: - mungkin bisa dipertimbangkan amenities, minimal sikat gigi dan pasta gigi, yang bisa diminta by request only. - arah ke sungai dan sekitar sungai apa perlu diberi tanda peringatan keamanan? kebetulan kemarin saat panas jadi arusnya kecil, tapi saat musim hujan tidak mustahil arusnya akan lebih deras.",got a chance to stay here with a promo price of only 300 thousand this is the second bobocabin in bogor and in puncak this one is relatively closer because it is still in the cipayung area while the other one is in puncak pa pro relatively closer to the toll road if there is a traffic jam the distance and time between cipayung and puncak pa will be really felt ambience is really good the atmosphere is calm at night during quiet hour it is really quiet there are only 10 cabin so it is relatively calm not many people going back and forth the wifi is quite fast the shared bathroom is clean friendly staff con same a the one in puncak pa the location is inside another resort the problem is the instruction are not very visible very small the digital key by qr code which is one of it advantage is actually broken in the cabin i stayed in given a manual door key eh cant be used to lock it either because i wa tired and lazy to complain a a result all night and until the next day the door wa only closed without being locked could be locked maybe the factor that there are only 10 cabin also make it feel relatively safe because there are not many people there is no drinking dispenser in the public kitchen so you have to boil water from the tap yourself while in the basic cabin there is no sink so you have to go to the shared bathroom the bed is hard this may be relative but for me it is hard when checking out in the morning at 7 checking out from the app cannot be done at least you have to wait until 10 suggestion maybe you can consider amenity at least toothbrush and toothpaste which can be requested by request only the direction to the river and around the river do you need to put a safety warning sign coincidentally yesterday when it wa hot so the current wa small but during the rainy season it is not impossible that the current will be stronger

Tony Suryana,3.0,2024-07-05 00:00:00,10,2719,tidak gratis parkir jadi harga booking tambahkan lagi 20.000 saat mempertimbangkan. yang payah akses ke kamar mandi harus pindah lantai. kalo buat transit yang kejar flight subuh sih tetap bisa dipertimbangkan. selain alasan tersebut lebih baik pakai capsule hotel lain saja.,no free parking so add another 20000 to the booking price when considering the poor bathroom access ha to move floor if for transit who are catching a dawn flight it can still be considered other than that reason it better to just use another capsule hotel

Bonjour Amira!,1.0,2024-01-14 00:00:00,1,3014,"saya menginap selama 3 malam di bobobox alun-alun bandung. pada malam pertama tidak ada masalah. lokasinya sangat strategis dan fasilitas cukup memadai. minusnya hanya tidak menyediakan tempat parkir baik untuk mobil ataupun motor, sehingga pelanggan yang membawa kendaraan diharuskan untuk parkir di tempat lain yang mana harus mengeluarkan biaya lagi.  namun pada malam kedua, pihak bobobox kedatangan rombongan study tour dari sebuah sama dari bukittinggi yang mana sangat-sangat berisik dan mengganggu tamu-tamu bobobox lain! saya tidak bisa tidur semalaman karena berisik.  saya sudah menegur siswa-siswa yang berisik tersebut namun tidak dihiraukan. saat saya komplain ke satpam dan resepsionis mereka mengiyakan namun hingga jam 10 malam lebih tidak ada yang menegur tamu-tamu tersebut. mungkin untuk ke depannya resepsionis dan satpam dapat lebih tegas dalam mengatur tamu-tamu yang berisik dan mengganggu, mengingat bobobox sendiri sudah memiliki kebijakan quiet hours dari jam 21.00-07.00. namun pada kenyataannya, saat ada tamu yang berisik dan mengganggu pada quiet hours tersebut, tidak ada satu pun pihak bobobox yang dapat mengambil langkah tegas untuk menegur. padahal ada tamu-tamu lain yang juga butuh waktu untuk istirahat dengan tenang.",i stayed for 3 night at bobobox alunalun bandung on the first night there wa no problem the location is very strategic and the facility are quite adequate the only downside is that it doe not provide a parking lot for car or motorbike so customer who bring vehicle are required to park elsewhere which requires additional cost however on the second night bobobox received a study tour group from a company from bukittinggi which wa very noisy and disturbed other bobobox guest i couldnt sleep all night because of the noise i have reprimanded the noisy student but they were ignored when i complained to the security guard and receptionist they agreed but until 10 pm no one had reprimanded the guest maybe in the future the receptionist and security guard can be more assertive in managing noisy and disturbing guest considering that bobobox itself already ha a quiet hour policy from 21000700 but in reality when there are noisy and disturbing guest during those quiet hour no one at bobobox can take firm step to reprimand them even though there are other guest who also need time to rest in peace

Indi Sugar Taufik,3.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,1,3140,"tanggal 2 september 2022 lalu aku memesan 2 pods untuk aku, suami, bapak dan satu anak usia 6 tahun. pengalaman yang cukup menyenangkan tapi kupikir ada hal-hal yang harus jadi perhatian dan bisa diimprove.  aku akan sebutkan kekurangannya dulu: 1. tidak ramah anak. padahal hanya perlu space kecil untuk playground mini. bisa ditaruh di common space, misalnya rooftop. 2. tidak ramah disabilitas. ini yang paling menggangguku. elevator sangat kecil dan hanya sampai lantai 3. selanjutnya hanya bisa menggunakan tangga yang terjal. jadi jika anda atau ingin mengajak teman/kelurga anda yang menggunakan kursi roda, lupakan saja. 4. wifi sangat lemah. 5. kebersihan kurang. ada gumpalan rambut di pojokan (di sudut tempat tidur). langsung dibersihkan setelah aku lapor. cara membersihkannya petugas naik ke atas tempat tidur yang sudah terpasang sprai, -aku merasa kurang hygiene :( 6. ukuran selimut terlalu kecil untuk dipakai berdua. 7. untuk snacks hanya bisa dibeli dengan dompet digital (seperti ovo, dll). kurang praktis terutama untuk seusia bapakku yang tidak punya aplikasi seperti itu. 8. akses masuk pod harus menggunakan hp. artinya saat ke kamar mandi pun hp harus dibawa, kecuali ada orang lain yang bisa membuka pintu pod dari dalam. berasa bawa-bawa kuman :(  meski begitu ada hal-hal yang aku ancungi jempol dari bobobox: 1. seluruh karyawannya ramah. bahkan securitynya. mereka juga helpful dan sabar. 2. fasilitas kamar mandi cukup bersih. terkadang ada tisu berceceran tapi setelah kucek beberapa jam kemudian sudah bersih. 3. lokasi dekat dengan mall dan supermarket. 4. tidak terlalu ramai meski akhir pekan.  saranku agar bobobox bisa lebih ""ramah"" untuk semua kalangan. tidak ada larangan orang tua, anak-anak dan disabilitas untuk menginap di sana kan? semua orang boleh punya pengalaman menginap di hotel kapsul. jadi pikirkan kembali aksesibilitasnya. untuk akses pintu kamar mungkin bisa diganti dengan kartu akses. model hp sekarang besar-besar. risih rasanya harus membawa hp untuk sekedar buang air kecil : /  terima kasih.",on september 2 2022 i ordered 2 pod for me my husband my father and a 6yearold child it wa quite a pleasant experience but i think there are thing that need to be considered and can be improved i will mention the shortcoming first 1 not childfriendly even though it only take a small space for a mini playground it can be placed in a common space such a a rooftop 2 not disabledfriendly this is what bother me the most the elevator is very small and only go to the 3rd floor then you can only use steep stair so if you or want to invite your friendsfamily who use wheelchair forget it 4 the wifi is very weak 5 lack of cleanliness there are clump of hair in the corner in the corner of the bed it wa cleaned immediately after i reported it how to clean it the staff climb onto the bed that ha been fitted with sheet i feel le hygienic 6 the size of the blanket is too small for two people to use 7 for snack can only be purchased with a digital wallet such a ovo etc le practical especially for my father age who doe not have an application like that 8 access to enter the pod must use a cellphone meaning that when going to the bathroom the cellphone must be brought unless there is someone else who can open the pod door from the inside feel like carrying germ even so there are thing that i give a thumb up to from bobobox 1 all employee are friendly even the security they are also helpful and patient 2 the bathroom facility are quite clean sometimes there are tissue scattered but after i check a few hour later it is clean 3 the location is close to the mall and supermarket 4 not too crowded even on weekend my suggestion is that bobobox can be more friendly to all group there is no prohibition on the elderly child and disability to stay there right everyone is allowed to have the experience of staying in a capsule hotel so think again about accessibility for room door access maybe it can be replaced with access card cell phone model nowadays are big it feel annoying to have to bring cell phone just to pee thank you

elok farida,4.0,2024-04-13 00:00:00,0,3261,"lokasinya strategis banget di alun-alun selatan malang. dibawah ada food court, mixue dan banyak pedagang kaki lima juga. suasananya ramai tapi kebisingan diluar tidak sampai masuk ke area pod. hanya saja memang dari lorong ke pod suaranya masuk. jadi langkah kaki orang, suara buka tutup pintu dan suara tetangga atas, samping, depan pod yang sedang mengobrol atau mendengarkan musik sampai terdengar ke pod kita. tapi karena saya bukan tipe yang tidak terlalu sensitif dengan suara suara saat tidur jadi masih cukup nyaman untuk saya menginap di bobopod ini. saya dapat harga 150 ribuan untuk pod kapasitas 2 orang sudah include sarapan/sahur untuk dua orang. menunya nasi uduk/nasi kuning. tapi karena saya solo traveling dan kebetulan makan malamnya terlambat jadi saat sahur tidak ambil makanannya karena masih kenyang dan agak malas keluar untuk makan menuju ke ruang komunal. oh iya, diperbolehkan membawa makanan ke pod hanya untuk disimpan saja. tidak boleh dimakan di dalam pod. makanan bisa dimakan di ruang komunal. space cukup luas dan bersih.",the location is very strategic in the southern square of malang below there is a food court mixue and many street vendor too the atmosphere is lively but the noise outside doe not enter the pod area it just that from the hallway to the pod the sound doe enter so people footstep the sound of door opening and closing and the sound of neighbor above beside in front of the pod who are chatting or listening to music can be heard in our pod but because im not the type who is not too sensitive to sound when sleeping so it still comfortable enough for me to stay in this bobopod i got a price of 150 thousand for a pod with a capacity of 2 people including breakfastsahur for two people the menu is uduk riceyellow rice but because i wa solo traveling and happened to have dinner late so when sahur i didnt take the food because i wa still full and a bit lazy to go out to eat to the communal room oh yeah it is allowed to bring food to the pod only to be stored it is not allowed to be eaten in the pod food can be eaten in the communal room the space is quite spacious and clean
Vini Salma Fadhilah,4.0,2024-03-14 00:00:00,0,3262,"dari beberapa bobopod yang pernah saya gunakan, yang di alun-alun malang ini cukup nyaman. ada balkon yang menghadap alun-alung kota. kalau pagi-pagi suasananya nyaman untuk membaca buku dan meminum teh.",of the several bobopods ive used the one in malang square is quite comfortable there is a balcony overlooking the town square in the morning the atmosphere is comfortable for reading a book and drinking tea
짱준이,5.0,2024-03-14 00:00:00,0,3263,"kapsul hotel ternyaman! sebelumnya pernah di kamar double, ternyata kamar single juga nyaman. cuma harus hati-hati saja pas naik turun kasur, soalnya agak tinggi. kamar mandi meskipun umum, tapi selalu bersih dan wangi. dapat breakfast cereal dan susu. di kamar ada speaker yang bisa connect ke hape atau tab, jadi oke banget buat menonton drakor. nyaman banget kalo cuma buat istirahat pas main ke malang",the most comfortable capsule hotel had been in a double room before it turned out that the single room wa also comfortable just have to be careful when going up and down the bed it quite high although the bathroom is public it is always clean and fragrant get breakfast cereal and milk in the room there is a speaker that can be connected to a cell phone or tab so it very good to watch drama it very comfortable if you just take a break after playing in malang

Pypy,2.0,2024-02-13 00:00:00,0,3270,"mau mencoba bagaimana sih rasanya tidur di hotel kapsul. ternyata pengalaman pertama cukup traumatik buat saya. dan akhirnya memutuskan cukup sekali saja.  setelah baca review saya memang sudah prepared ut kebisingan jalanan yang dekat dengan alun2. tapi ternyata saya kebrisikan dengan tetangga depan kamar yang sampai jam 2.30 pagi masih mengobrol. like literally mengobrol dengan suara normal, padahal ada jam tenang 9 malam - 7 pagi. anaknya yang kecil teriak2 enggak karuan. sudah begitu tamu di pod bawah bolak balik buka tutup pintu ngasal, dan mungkin ada gangguan sama colokannya bikin berisik banget ampun.  saking terganggunya saya sampai 2x chat host, telpon, dan tegur langsung, tetap enggak ngaruh.  kualitas built ini pod nya juga enggak begitu kedap sih.  saran: - bobopod musti buat aturan tegas soal ini. jangan mengabaikan hak penghuni lain untuk beristirahat. bisa saja ada aturan yang berisik, kena tegur 3x langsung diusir. - jangan terima tamu yang bawa toddler atau rombongan keluarga. - satpam dan atau karyawan lain jangan merokok dipintu masuk. ganggu banget.",want to try how it feel to sleep in a capsule hotel turn out the first experience wa quite traumatic for me and finally decided to just do it once after reading the review i wa prepared for the noise of the street near the town square but it turned out i wa noisy with the neighbor in front of the room who wa still chatting until 230 am like literally chatting in a normal voice even though there is a quiet hour from 9 pm 7 am his little child wa screaming incoherently then the guest in the pod below kept opening and closing the door randomly and maybe there wa interference with the plug making it really noisy i wa so disturbed that i chatted the host 2x called and reprimanded him directly but it still didnt work the build quality of this pod is also not that soundproof suggestion bobopod must make strict rule about this dont ignore the right of other resident to rest there could be a rule that if you are noisy you will be evicted if you are reprimanded 3 time dont accept guest who bring toddler or family group security guard andor other employee should not smoke at the entrance really disturbing
Heyou Nuka,5.0,2024-02-13 00:00:00,0,3271,"- strategis banyak jajanan, 2 hari disini kenyang di mana2 jualan makanan dan murah2 enak lagi aku suka - enggak akan dehidrasi karena dispenser di mana2 - air panas di shower agak kureng karena pas lagi mandi air tiba-tiba dingin atau nanti tiba-tiba panas banget wkwk - communal area nya luas dan banyak bangku nya bisa makan sambil lihat orang-orang activity di alun2 malang - breakfast dari jam 7 sampai 10 pagi - serba scan, kemana2 harus bawa hp karena scan2 pakai hp - mengomong jangan kenceng2 di pod, berisik nanti kedengaran sama tetangga - pegawai semua responsif dan tanggap, sat set - kalau bawa kendaraan bisa free parking, tinggal meminta stempel di receptionist, ada storage buat helm juga nanti bilang sama bapak security - kalau panggang roti jangan lama-lama, jangan menunggu sampai teng naik ke atas, nanti gosong - habis pakai piring atau alat makan coba di cuci mandiri ya, malas banget lihat orang yang habis pakai cuma di taro di wastafel atau yang habis makan sampah makanannya di biarkan saja di atas meja padahal tong sampah banyak di mana2 mager banget sih wkwk - ada musholla, toilet juga pisah cewek cowok jadi aman, closet dan shower terpisah tapi tolong dong yang pakai toilet benar-benar di perhatikan sampai bersih baru keluar, sama kalau habis pakai hair dryer terus rambutnya rontok jangan malah rambutnya di buang di wastafel atuh 🫠 - sejujur nya banyak banget peraturan di sini yang berbahasa inggris jadi mungkin banyak yang tidak mengerti ya sehingga ada beberapa yang di langgar, seperti meletakkan sendal di rak sepatu ketika sedang memasuki toilet, namun tentu nya sangat bisa bertanya kepada para staff jika tidak mengerti 👌 - jujur sih gambar orang-orang di tembok itu awal-awal ngagetin aku apalagi pas tengah malam ke toilet sendiri sepi, kayak tiba-tiba lihat ada orang berdiri jadi takut - alat coffee to go nya keren lebih otomatis dari yang aku temui di bobobox jakarta 👍🏻",strategic lot of snack 2 day here im full where the food is sold and cheap and i like it i wont get dehydrated because of the dispenser everywhere the hot water in the shower is a bit lacking because the water suddenly get cold when i take a shower or it suddenly very hot wkwk the communal area is wide and there are many bench where you can eat while watching people activity in the malang square breakfast from 7 to 10 am everything is scanned where do you have to bring your phone because you use your phone to scan when you say dont be too loud in the pod it will be noisy later it sound like a neighbor the officer are all responsive and responsive everything is set if you bring a vehicle you can park for free just ask the receptionist for a stamp there is also storage for helmet i will tell you later if you bake bread dont take too long dont wait until you get up to the top later it will be burnt after using the plate or cutlery try washing them yourself it too lazy to see people who have used them just put them in the sink or who have eaten their food waste and leave it on the table even though there are many trash can everywhere hey wkwk there is a musholla the toilet is also separate for girl and boy so it safe the closet and shower are separate but please dong those who use the toilet really pay attention to it until it clean before leaving it the same if you use a hair dryer and your hair continues to fall out dont even throw your hair in the sink yes to be honest there are a lot of rule here that are in english so maybe a lot of people dont understand so there are some that are violated like putting sandal on the shoe rack when entering the toilet but of course you can ask the staff if you dont understand to be honest the picture of people on the wall startled me from the start especially when i went to the toilet alone in the middle of the night it wa like i suddenly saw someone standing and got scared the coffee to go device is cool and more automatic than what i found at bobobox jakarta

Felia Nuvria Sari,5.0,2024-02-13 00:00:00,0,3275,"tips : 1. pilih tipe pod yang bawah /earth yang double karena ukuran cukup luas dan enggak harus manjat dulu tiap mau istirahat. 2. meskipun ada selimut, bawa jaket karena di dalem pod yang selalu tertutup dan kontrol ac yang enggak begitu kasih impact. 3. karena barcode enggak bisa di ss dan segala akses harus buka apk, kadang cukup lama saat load prefer foto pakai ponsel lain lalu save galeri. atau segera buka brcode sebelum di depan pintu karena cukup bikin antri yang lain.  honest review:  fasilitas 5/5 setiap pod memberi kesan terbaik dengan fitur canggihnya, toilet selalu bersih meskipun sharing, ada refill air putih juga, mushola lengkap dengan mukena sajadah sarung dan tempat wudhu.  layanan 5/5 staff ramah, sabar, tanggap, dan baik banget helpfully  kenyamanan 4/5 kasur memang lumayan keras tapi so far masih bisa tidur, ac tetap dingin parah meskipun kontrol di atas sudah ditutup ,dan cukup noise antar pod sky dengan earth.",tip 1 choose the bottom pod type earth double because the size is quite spacious and you dont have to climb first every time you want to rest 2 even though there is a blanket bring a jacket because inside the pod it is always closed and the ac control doesnt really give an impact 3 because the barcode cant be s and all access must open the app sometimes it take quite a long time to load prefer taking photo using another cellphone then save the gallery or immediately open the barcode before in front of the door because it make others queue honest review facility 55 each pod give the best impression with it sophisticated feature the toilet is always clean even though it is shared there is also a refill of drinking water a complete prayer room with prayer mat sarong and a place for ablution service 55 staff are friendly patient responsive and very kind helpfully comfort 45 the mattress is quite hard but so far i can still sleep the ac is still very cold even though the control above is closed and there is quite noise between the sky and earth pod

Monica Graselia,3.0,2023-08-17 00:00:00,0,3314,"baru pertama kali nginap di bobobox, kamar nya kecil tapi enak juga, saran saya ambil yang diatas, karena kalau yang dibawah, takutnya berisik sama yang diatas dan terdengar jelas tapak kaki orang-orang. kamar mandinya bagus, bersih, dan ada banyak jadi enggak perlu antri. cuma hair dryer nya suka mati baru dipakai beberapa menit. lokasi bagus banget, persis di seberang alun-alun malang di pusat kota, kemana-mana dekat. tempat tidur nyaman juga.  yang saya paling enggak suka disini adalah, berisik. suara orang di luar yang berbicara, berjalan, geret koper, buka-tutup pintu, kedengaran banget, dan suara nya kencang banget. saya enggak bisa tidur disini, karena baru mau tidur selalu saja ada suara, padahal sudah ditulis quiet time, tapi enggak ngaruh tuh sama tamu disana, enggak ada yang negur juga. apalagi buka tutup pintu nya, berisik banget, harusnya sekelas bobobox, pintu nya enggak berisik pas ditutup dan dibuka, ini kencang banget bahkan sudah pelan-pelan, pintunya tetap berisik, brak brak brak brak suaranya kayak dibanting, buset, bagaimana mau tidur. mana 1 ruangan semua kamar kapsul digabung ada 60-an, semua yang buka tutup pintu berisik banget jadinya. harusnya dipisah begitu per kamar kayak hostel lain, jadi enggak terlalu berisik semuanya.",it my first time staying at bobobox the room is small but nice too my advice is to take the one above because if the one below im afraid it a noisy a the one above and you can clearly hear people footstep the bathroom is nice clean and there are many so no need to queue only the hair dryer like to die after using it for a few minute very good location right across malang square in the city center close to everywhere the bed is comfortable too what i dont like here the most is it noisy the voice of people outside talking walking dragging suitcase opening and closing door are very audible and their voice are very loud i cant sleep here because when i want to sleep there is always a sound even though it is written quiet time but it doesnt affect the guest there no one complains either let alone open and close the door it very noisy it should be like a bobobox the door doesnt make noise when it closed and opened it very loud even slowly the door is still noisy brak brak brak brak it sound like it being slammed buset how do you want to sleep where 1 room all the capsule room combined there are 60 everything that open and close the door is very noisy it should be separated per room like other hostel so everything is not too noisy

Syifa,5.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,0,3363,"dari semua capsule hotel yang pernah saya coba, bobobox adalah favorit saya! karena: 1. ada ruang gerak untuk penginap di dalam pods, sehingga kami bisa ganti baju ataus ekedar stretching dengan leluasa. 2. kamar mandi memang sharing namun dipisah antara kamar mandi perempuan dan laki-laki, sehingga privasi lebih terjaga apalagi buat wanita berjilbab. 3. bersih! petugasnya menepati schedule membersihkan toilet. 4. lokasi di pusat kota 5. terdapat makanan cepat saji yang dijual dekat receptionist, jadi kalo merasa lapar anda bisa langsung beli makanan dan bayar di receptionist.  kekurangannya hanya tidak ada staff cleaning perempuan jadi yang membersihkan kamar mandi perempuan adalah staff pria, ya dapat diakali dengan tidak memakai kamar mandi saat staff membersihkan kamar mandi.",of all the capsule hotel ive tried bobobox is my favorite because 1 there is room for guest to move around in the pod so we can change clothes or just stretch freely 2 the bathroom are shared but separated between the woman and men bathroom so privacy is more maintained especially for woman who wear the hijab 3 clean the staff keep their schedule to clean the toilet 4 location in the city center 5 there is fast food sold near the receptionist so if you feel hungry you can immediately buy food and pay at the receptionist the only drawback is that there are no female cleaning staff so the one who clean the woman bathroom are male staff yes you can get around it by not using the bathroom when the staff is cleaning the bathroom

Fahmi Prayoga,5.0,2023-08-17 00:00:00,8,4783,tempat penginapan yang mengusung konsep berbeda dengan yang lain. nyaman untuk ukuran double bed karena bisa agak luas. sementara untuk ukuran single menurut saya agak terlalu kecil. utamanya bagi pembawa barang yang cukup banyak. suasana tidur dalam 'box' memang berbeda. nyaman. ada berbagai macam suasana ambience light yang dapat disesuaikan dengan selera. backsound air ataupun burung juga dapat disertakan dalam box. sangat strategis letaknya karena benar-benar di tengah-tengah dari kota lama semarang yang menjadi salah satu area wisata di semarang. pelayanan bagus. alas kaki aman karena ada box penyimpanan yang akan ditukar dengan alas kaki khusus di dalam area bobobox. kamar mandi dan wc tidak cukup banyak memang. tapi jika di momen yang tidak crowded seperti long weekend juga tidak terlalu masalah dengan hal ini. atau bisa diakali dengan mandi diawal waktu dan sejenisnya. mantab habis.,a place to stay that carry a different concept from the others comfortable for a double bed size because it can be a bit spacious while for a single size in my opinion it is a bit too small especially for those carrying quite a lot of luggage the atmosphere of sleeping in a box is indeed different comfortable there are various kind of ambience light atmosphere that can be adjusted to taste backsound water or bird can also be included in the box very strategic location because it is right in the middle of the old city of semarang which is one of the tourist area in semarang good service footwear is safe because there is a storage box that will be exchanged for special footwear in the bobobox area bathroom and toilet are not enough indeed but if at a moment that is not crowded like a long weekend it is also not too much of a problem with this or you can trick it by taking a shower early and the like really cool

BANG bamBANG,4.0,2024-06-12 00:00:00,5,4996,"sebenarnya ingin kasih nilai 5 karena strategis, bersih, aman dan nyaman. -1 bintangnya karena pungli parkir.  saya ceritakan pengalaman saya : jadi saya sebelum booking bobopod di kota tua, saya riset dulu dari review di youtube dan maps. jadi tahu persis lokasinya di mana, apakah bisa ke sana dengan petunjuk google maps. setelah saya sampai dan hendak masuk ke parkiran, saya di setop oleh bapak2 tanpa seragam, saya posisi sudah belok kanan nanjak ke parkiran gedung. sesaat kemudian barulah saya tersadar ada cone yang menutupi pintu masuk parkir gedung, saya seketika menyimpulkan parkiran gedung sudah penuh dan langsung ambil parkiran di luar, keluar dari mobil biaya parkirnya langsung diminta 25 ribu rupiah, tanpa karcis. setelah itu saya menuju hotel untuk cek ini, ternyata yang parkir dalam gedung nya cuma ada 1 mobil dan masih bisa parkir beberapa mobil.  ketika check ini resepsionis menjelaskan bahwa parkir depan gedung tidak bisa sampai pagi, dan mobil saya harus dipindahkan ke parkiran dalam gedung, dan tiket parkirnya dibawa ke resepsionis untuk diberi stempel. singkat cerita saya check out keesokan harinya. saya memberikan tiket parkir yang sudah diberi stempel, kemudian penjaga parkirnya bilang ""oh, nginep di bobobox, mau balik lagi atau check out pak?"" kemudian menulis sesuatu di dalam pos jaga parkir, setelah itu kembali melihat saya dan bilang ""20 ribu pak"". saya cuma bisa menggerutu dalam hati. saya kira itu tiket parkir diberi stempel sebagai penanda parkir untuk tamu bobobox gratis, ternyata tetap bayar.  yang saya enggak habis pikir, ketika saya protes ke satpam (pak botak) parkiran setelah dapat info dari resepsionis tadi. saya : pak saya mau memasuki mob- botak : mau kemana?! saya : bobobox pak botak : yaudah memasuki saja~ saya : kok saya tadi mau masuk disetop ya? botak : disuruh siapa? saya : itu di depan tadi saya mau masuk kok- botak : disuruh siapa?!! saya : (buset tamu dibentak) itu yang di depan, ada cone nya juga menutupi jalan masuk parkiran botak : oh bilang saja mau ke bobobox entar juga dia tau dibukain jalannya sama dia (sambil membuang muka)  di situ saya menyerah mengomong sama sih botak dan langsung bertindak memindahkan mobil. tau enggak? yang jaga parkir ganti orang. dia kira saya mau keluar, yasudah saya bilang ""mau pindah parkir ke dalem di bobobox, itu jalannya ditutup"" dia jawab ""penuh kali parkirannya"" langsung saya jawab ""enggak penuh itu"". baru dibukain cone penutup jalannya sama dia.  jadi kesimpulannya saya nginep di bobobox kota tua semalam, untuk parkir mobil doang habis 45 ribu rupiah. saya curiga nya sih botak dapat jatah dari hasil pungli, atau memang enggak berani saja sama punglinya.",actually want to give a score of 5 because it is strategic clean safe and comfortable 1 star because of parking extortion let me tell you my experience so before booking bobopod in the old city i first researched from review on youtube and map so i know exactly where the location is whether i can get there with google map direction after i arrived and wa about to enter the parking lot i wa stopped by a man without a uniform i wa already turning right uphill to the building parking lot a moment later i realized there wa a cone covering the entrance to the building parking lot i immediately concluded that the building parking lot wa full and immediately took a parking lot outside got out of the car and wa immediately asked for a parking fee of 25 thousand rupiah without a ticket after that i went to the hotel to check this it turned out that there wa only 1 car parked in the building and several car could still be parked when checking in the receptionist explained that parking in front of the building could not be until morning and my car had to be moved to the parking lot in the building and the parking ticket wa brought to the receptionist to be stamped long story short i checked out the next day i gave the stamped parking ticket then the parking attendant said oh staying at bobobox do you want to come back or check out sir then wrote something in the parking guard post then looked back at me and said 20 thousand sir i could only grumble in my heart i thought the parking ticket wa stamped a a marker for free parking for bobobox guest but it turned out they still had to pay what i couldnt understand wa when i protested to the parking security guard mr bald after getting information from the receptionist earlier me sir i want to enter the car bald where are you going me bobobox mr bald okay just go in me why did you stop me when i wa about to enter bald who told you to me it wa in front earlier i wanted to enter bald who told you to me wow the guest wa yelled at that one in front there a cone also blocking the entrance to the parking lot baldy oh just tell him you want to go to bobobox hell find out later hell open the way while looking away at that point i gave up talking to baldy and immediately moved the car you know what the parking attendant changed people he thought i wanted to go out so i said want to move parking to the inside of bobobox the way is closed he replied probably the parking lot is full i immediately replied it not full then he opened the cone blocking the way so the conclusion is i stayed at bobobox in old city for one night just for parking the car it cost 45 thousand rupiah i suspect baldy got his share from extortion or he just didnt have the courage to do the extortion

Item Lee,5.0,2022-07-13 00:00:00,5,5102,"tiba di sini sekitar jam 8 malam. pas mau parkir agak bingung karena pintu masuk untuk keperkirannya di depan banyak orang jualan entah ada even atau apa enggak mengerti soalnya baru pertama nginep di daerah sini. dan pas masuk juga kayak enggak yakin ya karena lewat tangga pikiran sudah macam macam nih jangan sampai tempatnya lusuh blablabla. eh pas masuk enggak dong tempatnya bersih dan terawat ternyata cuma pas jalanan di tangganya saja. pas sampai di receptionist di meminta untuk scan dan ukur suhu, serta dijelaskan juga untuk masuk podsnya. cuma pakai barcode dari hp dan enggak usah pakai kunci. sebelum masuk ke pods tamu diminta untuk melepas sendal dan menggunakan sendal yang sudah di sediakan. dan bagi yang tidak ingin mondar mandi silakan meminta sikat gigi dan cup sekalian diawal. di pods ada meja juga dan tempat sampah tapi tidak diizinkan makan di pods karena sudah di sediakan tempat makan bersama. untuk toiletnya pria dan wanita di pisah ya, dan tidak jauh dari toilet ada mushola juga. untuk yang tidurnya biasanya lampunya gelap ini juga bisa di atur ya. seinget aku ada aturannya juga jam 21.00-07.00 diminta untuk menjaga ketenangan agar tidak mengganggu tamu yang lain, karena kamar tamu yang lain bisa saja ada di atas atau di bawah pods kita. karena saya sempat terganggu dengan tamu yang ada di atas saya, sudah hampir subuh masih terdengar sangat ramai. kalo menurutku ini bobobox ini cocok untuk backpacker. dengan ukuran kamar yang pas, bersih dan nyaman. mungkin agas susah bagi yang sudah berumah tangga apa lagi yang memiliki balita. untuk kebersihanya semoga tetap selalu di jaga agar pelanggan selalu merasa nyaman.",arrived here around 8 pm when i wanted to park i wa a bit confused because the entrance to the parking lot wa in front of many people selling i dont know if there wa an event or what i dont understand because it wa my first time staying in this area and when i entered i also felt unsure because i wa going through the stair my thought were all over the place dont let the place be shabby blah blah blah eh when i entered no the place wa clean and wellmaintained it turned out it wa only along the stair when i arrived at the receptionist i wa asked to scan and measure my temperature and wa also explained how to enter the pod just use the barcode from your cellphone and no key is needed before entering the pod guest are asked to take off their sandal and use the sandal that have been provided and for those who dont want to go around taking a shower please ask for a toothbrush and cup at the beginning in the pod there are also table and trash can but eating is not allowed in the pod because a shared dining area ha been provided for men and woman toilet are separated and not far from the toilet there is also a prayer room for those who usually sleep the light are dark this can also be adjusted a i recall there is also a rule from 21000700 to maintain silence so a not to disturb other guest because other guest room could be above or below our pod because i wa disturbed by the guest above me it wa almost dawn and it still sounded very noisy in my opinion this bobobox is suitable for backpacker with the right room size clean and comfortable maybe gnat are difficult for those who are married especially those with toddler for cleanliness hopefully it will always be maintained so that customer always feel comfortable

Raihaana Rizky,5.0,2022-07-13 00:00:00,5,5104,"pengalaman pertama mencoba nginep di bobobox karena penasaran sama hotel kapsul. untuk jaga-jaga, sejak awal aku pilih kasur yang double bed, tapi ternyta enggak sesempit bayangan aku (walaupun sampai sekarang juga belum pernah mencoba yang single sih). fitur terdabesnya sih suara sungai dan hutan yang ada di tablet pods nya. nuansa tidur malam benaran berasa di dekat sungai atau di tengah hutan soalnya, menambah kesan saat menginap.  lokasinya memang agak nyelip, jadi tanya orang saja pasti akan di arahin. pintu utamanya tutup mengikuti jam tutupnya kotu, jadi kalau sudah jam 9 pintu yang beroperasi adalah pintu belakang, dimana dekat sama deretan pedagang kaki lima. tapi seperti kebanyakan masalah di tempat wisata, harganya lebih dari biasanya dan rasanya agak kurang oke. aku pribadi lebih pilih makan kerak telor saja karena harganya 25k dan rasanya terjamin enak.  untuk kamar mandi oke banget, shower berfungsi dengan baik. wc nya juga bersih. yang senang dari mulai masuk, dimana-mana itu wangi, jadi senang deh. public areanya juga lengkap karena nyediain air panas, dan microwave. bahkan di hari kedua aku nginep, aku ditawarin untuk digantiin sprei selimut, sama handuknya. tapi karena aku mikirnya boros toh yang memakai aku aku juga, jadi ku tolak.  enaknya lagi, karena lokasinya ada di dalam area kota tua, jadi pas pagi bisa foto museum fatahillah dengan leluasa karena masih sepi. keliling olahraga pagi di alun-alun juga bisa. so, overall pengalaman pertamaku nginep di bobobox oke banget sih dan pengin buat balik lagi. thank you.",first experience trying to stay at bobobox because i wa curious about capsule hotel just in case from the beginning i chose a double bed but it turned out not to be a narrow a i imagined although until now i have never tried a single one the most amazing feature is the sound of the river and forest on the tablet pod the nuance of sleeping at night really feel like being near a river or in the middle of a forest adding to the impression when staying the location is indeed a bit tucked away so just ask people and they will definitely direct you the main door close according to the city closing time so if it 9 oclock the only door that operates is the back door which is close to a row of street vendor but like most problem in tourist attraction the price is more than usual and the taste is a bit le good i personally prefer to eat egg crust because it cost 25k and the taste is guaranteed to be delicious the bathroom is really okay the shower work well the toilet is also clean whats nice is that from the moment you enter everywhere smell good so im happy the public area is also complete because it provides hot water and a microwave even on the second day i stayed i wa offered to change the sheet blanket and towel but because i thought it wa wasteful since i wa the one using it so i refused the good thing is because the location is in the old city area so in the morning i can take picture of the fatahillah museum freely because it is still quiet walking around the town square in the morning is also possible so overall my first experience staying at bobobox wa really good and i want to come back again thank you

Fildzah Raihan,5.0,2022-07-13 00:00:00,11,5509,"sudah pernah 2x ke sini, yang earth single sama sky single. lebih suka yang di earth karena kasurnya enggak lebih tinggi, jadi ada space lebih leluasa buat taruh barang. kasur bukan yang empuk banget tapi bantal sama selimutnya nyaman banget. bersih banget juga pod-nya. setiap pod dapat semacam layar untuk atur warna dan intensitas terang lampu, kunci pintu, san bisa connect bluetooth juga untuk speaker. area kasur kalau dipakai duduk masih ada space di atas kepala sejengkal lah, masih bisa dipakai ngerjain juga. kalau enggak masalah sama ruangan sempit menurutku ini sudah cukup banget.  kamar mandi bersama juga bersih, ada hair dryer, sabun, shampoo. dapat vitamin juga bisa diambil gratis di meja resepsionis. ada musholla juga.  lokasi strategis banget dekat makanan, pasar, halte bis, tourism information, toko oleh-oleh. selisih setoko sama starbucks juga.  recommended buat solo traveler yang mau ngehabisin waktu lama di jogja, atau butuh buat kerja, karena lebih dapat privasinya dibandingkan dorm.",ive been here twice the earth single and the sky single i prefer the one on the ground because the mattress is not higher so there is more space to put thing the mattress is not very soft but the pillow and blanket are very comfortable the pod is also very clean each pod can have a kind of screen to set the color and intensity of the light lock the door and can connect bluetooth to the speaker a well the mattress area if used to sit still ha space above the head for a span it can still be used for work a well if there is no problem with the narrow space i think this is enough the shared bathroom is also clean there is a hair dryer soap shampoo vitamin can also be taken for free at the reception desk there is also a musholla very strategic location near food market bus stop tourism information souvenir shop the difference is the same a starbucks recommended for solo traveler who want to spend a long time in jogja or need to do work because they get more privacy than dorm

Raihaana Rizky,4.0,2022-07-13 00:00:00,32,5757,"secara tempat cukup strategis, ke tengah jakarta dekat, ke tebet yang pusat jajanan hits jakarta juga dekat. tapi karena lokasinya ada di ruko, jadi ada biaya parkirnya, sehari 50, jadi aku yang nginep 3 hari 2 malam perlu bayar 15.0.  secara layout kamarnya, aku sempat kebingungan karena ternyata musholla dan public area adanya hanya di lantai 3 saja. mobilisasi antar lantainya sih enak karena ada liftnya. untuk kamar sama saja setiap bobobox.  hanya saja yang kurang di bagian kamar mandinya sih, air showernya enggak jelas begitu panas dinginnya, sudah arahin ke kanan masih saja air panas yang keluar, jadi bingung musti bagaimana. kalo masalah aliran air yang tina tiba kencang terus biasa saja begitu sih masih normallah ya. dan semprotan di wc nya juga ada yang nyemprotnya kurang, ada yang agak miring airnya, dll. servicenya sih yang aku suka banget, mas resepsionisnya ramah.  overall semua oke, pengalamanku juga tetap asik. dan enggak kapok nginep disitu lagi. cuman kadang keberisikan sama tetangga kamar saja karena cuma dibatasin triplek tebal.",in term of location it is quite strategic close to the center of jakarta and close to tebet the center of jakarta trendy snack but because the location is in a shophouse there is a parking fee 50 per day so i who stayed for 3 day and 2 night had to pay 150 in term of the room layout i wa confused because it turned out that the prayer room and public area were only on the 3rd floor mobility between floor is good because there is an elevator the room are the same a every bobobox the only thing lacking is the bathroom the shower water is not clear how hot or cold it is i have turned it to the right but hot water still come out so im confused about what to do if there is a problem with the water flow it still normal right and the spray in the toilet is also lacking some of the water is a bit slanted etc the service is what i really like the receptionist is friendly overall everything is okay my experience is still fun and i dont regret staying there again it just that sometimes it get noisy from neighboring room because it only limited by thick plywood

Dian Adriani David,3.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,2,6044,"agaknya sistem yang otomatis ini membuat kehadiran karyawan di front desk tidak terlalu penting ya. setidaknya kesan yang saya dapat adalah bahwa ux dari aplikasinya harus bisa kita pahami sendiri, tidak perlu dijelaskan oleh karyawan. jadi, ya kalau menginap di sini tidak perlu berharap sapaan ramah dari karyawan seperti di hotel :)  kali ini saya memesan single pod, letaknya di lantai 2, jadi saya perlu mengangkat koper ke lantai 2. sampai di lantai 2, kebetulan sekali saya dapat pod no 42. dan no 42, adalah salah 2 nomor yang tidak ada di denahnya :) jadi saya harus bolak balik menggeret koper untuk mencari podnya.  podnya sendiri adalah mungkin alasan saya untuk memesan hotel kapsul ini. untuk ukuran hotel kapsul, kamarnya nyaman, dan aksesnya mudah menuju bandara.  tambahan catatan untuk area mushala. baik di luar area mushala (area communal) dan lantai mushalanya sendiri, becek ketika hujan.  good pointnya adalah, satpamnya benar-benar baik dan ramah. dari mulai parkir, turunin koper, nitip barang, semua diprovide dengan baik dan full senyum oleh satpam :)",it seems that this automatic system make the presence of employee at the front desk not too important at least the impression i got is that the ux of the application should be understandable by ourselves no need to be explained by employee so if you stay here you dont need to expect a friendly greeting from employee like in a hotel this time i booked a single pod located on the 2nd floor so i needed to lift my suitcase to the 2nd floor when i got to the 2nd floor i happened to get pod number 42 and number 42 is one of the 2 number that is not on the map so i had to go back and forth dragging my suitcase to find the pod the pod itself is probably the reason i booked this capsule hotel for a capsule hotel the room is comfortable and it ha easy access to the airport additional note for the prayer room area both outside the prayer room area communal area and the prayer room floor itself are muddy when it rain the good point is the security guard are really good and friendly starting from parking unloading suitcase leaving item everything is provided well and with a full smile by the security guard

Vera Dian Mutiara,1.0,2023-10-16 00:00:00,9,6260,"tidak ada issue dengan kamar, service dan lokasinya. pilih bobobox karena dekat dengan venue pocari tourism run yang akan start di pasar triwindu, kebetulan pas search muncul pod hotel ini. secara segmen yang namanya pod hotel target marketnya middle low. backpacker dari luar negeri yang pastinya tidak membawa kendaraan atau mungkin tourist lokal sekitaran jawa tengah yang transportnya bisa ditempuh dengan motor dan pastinya tidak akan menjadi issue untuk parkiran.  tapi, untuk sebagain orang termasuk saya yang mampir ke solo dengan menggunakan mobil. kami benar-benar tidak merasa tidak nyaman dengan perlakuan petugas parkir di depan hotel. dari awal kami sudah info bahwa kami menginap di bobobox, dengan alasan hari minggu car free day disepanjang jl selamat riyadi kami “dipaksa” untuk memindahkan mobil ke mcd yang letaknya sebelum hotel (artinya kami harus cari jalan memutar karena one way). saya parkir saat check ini jam 2, kemudian jalan kaki cari makan didaerah keprabon jam 5an. saat pulang petugas parkir yang sama, bpk dengan postur yang tidak begitu tinggi rambut di kuncir panjang dan memakai topi kembali “mengintimidasi” kami dan menanyakan kapan mobil mau dipindahin? akhirnya saya marah dan meminta dia ikut ke reception karena waktu check ini diawal saya diinfo “kalo petugas parkirnya tanya bilang saja sudah dari kami”  terimakasih kepada pihak hotel yang sudah memberikan solusi, but it’s big no untuk stay disini lagi mengingat petugas parkir yang lebih mirip dengan preman itu tidak suka “lahan parkirnya” dipakai berjam2  i mean, kita nginep dihotel ya enggak mungkin lah parkir 1-2 jam semacam hotel esek2.",no issue with the room service and location choose bobobox because it is close to the pocari tourism run venue which will start at the triwindu market coincidentally when searching this pod hotel appeared in term of the segment called pod hotel the target market is middle low backpacker from abroad who certainly do not bring vehicle or maybe local tourist around central java whose transportation can be taken by motorbike and certainly will not be an issue for parking but for some people including me who stopped by solo by car we really did not feel uncomfortable with the treatment of the parking attendant in front of the hotel from the beginning we were informed that we were staying at bobobox with the reason that sunday wa car free day along jl selamat riyadi we were forced to move the car to the mcd which wa located before the hotel meaning we had to find a detour because it wa one way i parked when i checked in at 2 then walked to find food in the keprabon area at 5 when we went home the same parking attendant a man with a not so tall posture with long hair in a ponytail and wearing a hat again intimidated u and asked when the car would be moved finally i got angry and asked him to come to the reception because at the time of checkin at the beginning i wa informed if the parking attendant asks just say it from u thank you to the hotel for providing a solution but it a big no to stay here again considering the parking attendant who is more like a thug doesnt like his parking lot being used for hour i mean if we stay at the hotel it impossible to park for 12 hour like a sex hotel

Defri Duantika,3.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00,9,6318,"secara lokasi tempatnya strategis karena di pusat kota. sebelum masuk pod harus tukar alas kaki dan naroh sepatu di loker. check ini baru bisa jam 2 kalo datang sebelum itu ya menunggu. mushola dan tempat makan ada di lantai. 3 kalo makan gaboleh di pod harus ke tempat makannya. karena saya cuma sebentar enggak sempat eksplor ke lantai lainnya.  saya menempati kamar sky single. saya kira tangga buat naiknya besar ternyata mojok dan kecil banget agak ngeri naik tangganya. kasurnya bersih, tapi pas saya check ini ada pengunjung yang komplain karena kasurnya banyak rambutnya, jadi meminta diganti. ac nya dingin, fitur lampu baik, suara juga baik, wifi termasuk kencang, hanya bluetooth speakernya enggak berfungsi.  kamar mandi di ujung lorong tiap lantai, ada bilik untuk mandi dan sekedar bak/bab. kebersihannya kurang ya dan agak berbau.",the location is strategic because it is in the city center before entering the pod you have to change your footwear and put your shoe in the locker checkin is only possible at 2 oclock if you arrive before that you have to wait the prayer room and dining area are on the 3rd floor if you cant eat in the pod you have to go to the dining area because i only had a short stay i didnt have time to explore the other floor i occupied a sky single room i thought the stair to go up were big but it turned out to be in the corner and very small it wa a bit scary to climb the stair the mattress wa clean but when i checked in there wa a visitor who complained because the mattress had a lot of hair so they asked for it to be replaced the ac is cold the lighting feature are good the sound is also good the wifi is quite fast only the bluetooth speaker doesnt work the bathroom is at the end of the hall on each floor there is a cubicle for showering and just a tubdefecation the cleanliness is lacking and it smell a bit

Ivan hanif,4.0,2021-07-13 00:00:00,9,6481,"pengalaman saya ketika menginap di bobobox solo pertama kali adalah pengalaman baru resepsionis yang welcome banget mengarahkan hingga tamu paham, kamar yang modern dimana kita tak perlu kunci lagi untuk membuka pintu melainkan memakai code qr, kamar mandinya terbilang bersih tapi ketika saya menginap malamnya terasa bau air kencing yang menyengat tetapi keesokan harinya baunya sudah tidak ada dan juga kamar mandi dan wcnya terbilang sedikit jadi terkadang kita harus mengantri kamar mandi ataupun wcnya, ac dingin dan juga untuk bantal dan kasur nyaman disini tidak ada parkiran khusus untuk bobobox jadi yang mau bermalam disini harus berani parkir di pinggir jalan, yang tentunya beresiko saya tidak sempat ke lantai 3 karena kebetulan saya tidak makan malam ataupun sarapan masukan pribadi : sering cek sprei, bantal dan juga selimut karena di selimut tadi ada bercak darah dan juga bantalnya terdapat sedikit bekas darah juga overall good",my experience when staying at bobobox solo for the first time wa a new experience the receptionist wa very welcoming and guided the guest until they understood the room wa modern where we didnt need a key to open the door but used a qr code the bathroom wa fairly clean but when i stayed the night there wa a strong smell of urine but the next day the smell wa gone and also the bathroom and toilet were relatively few so sometimes we had to queue for the bathroom or toilet the air conditioner wa cold and also for the pillow and mattress were comfortable here there is no special parking for bobobox so those who want to spend the night here must dare to park on the side of the road which of course is risky i didnt have time to go to the 3rd floor because i happened to not have dinner or breakfast personal input often check the sheet pillow and also the blanket because there were blood stain on the blanket and also the pillow had a little blood stain overall good
Febrian Tantya Putra,5.0,2021-07-13 00:00:00,9,6482,"menginap 1 malam di hotel ini untuk pertama kali, kesan pertamanya nyaman. penjelasan dari fo sangat jelas dan dapat dimengerti dengan baik. tidak perlu memberikan deposit saat checkin, setelah diberikan penjelasan, bisa langsung ke kamar. kunci yang didapatkan hanya kunci loker untuk mengganti sendal/ sepatu dengan alas kaki yang diwajibkan dipakai selama di hotel. kunci kamar menggunakan qr-code yang ada di aplikasi. saya mendapat kamar di lantai 2, sky pod 1 orang, kecil tapi nyaman. awalnya bingung naiknya bagaimana, karena ruang yang cukup sempit sehingga membutuhkan sedikit usaha untuk naik ke atas, terutama bagi orang yang memiliki kapasitas badan yang lebih dari biasanya. di kamar sudah disediakan peralatan mandi, seperti handuk, sikat gigi, odol, dan air mineral, untuk sabun, shampo, dan pengering rambut disediakan di kamar mandi. disediakan pula dua colokan di dekat jendela, saya rasa cukup untuk charge handphone dan laptop. ruang gerak di kamar tidak banyak, yang harus diingat adalah kepala. untuk kamar mandi, sharing, dibedakan antara pria dan wanita. untuk kamar mandi pria, di malam hari, masih bersih, tidak ada sampah sama sekali. tapi ketika keesokan hari, sampah mulai muncul dan ditinggalkan begitu saja, saya rasa ini masalah tanggung jawab individu. airnya bersih, bisa panas dan dingin, tidak ada keluhan sama sekali mengenai air. di dalam kamar mandi, ada gantungan dan tempat datar untuk menaruh barang. memang tidak ada area khusus merokok di hotel ini, namun di lantai 2, dekat kamar mandi ada area terbuka. di lantai 3 ada pantry dan mushola, bersih, tapi tempat sampahnya kecil sehingga banyak sampah yang ditumpuk di situ, padahal tempat makan. disediakan piring, sendok, cangkir, lengkap dengan sabun cucinya, namun bisa lebih baik lagi jika disediakan sabun cuci tangan. ada microwave dan water heater juga. untuk parkiran memang tidak ada, jadi yang membawa kendaraan, terutama mobil harus berani parkir di pinggir jalan besar. berhubung saya tidak menggunakan kendaraan, jadi tidak tahu tarif parkirnya berapa. overall good, pilihan yang hemat untuk beristirahat, ac dingin dan koneksi internet yang cepat",stayed 1 night at this hotel for the first time the first impression wa comfortable the explanation from the fo wa very clear and understandable no need to give a deposit when checking in after being given an explanation you can go straight to the room the key you get is only a locker key to change sandalsshoes with footwear that must be worn while in the hotel the room key us a qrcode in the application i got a room on the 2nd floor sky pod 1 person small but comfortable at first i wa confused about how to go up because the space is quite narrow so it take a little effort to go up especially for people who have a body capacity that is more than usual in the room there are toiletry provided such a towel toothbrush toothpaste and mineral water for soap shampoo and hair dryer are provided in the bathroom there are also two plug near the window i think it enough to charge your cellphone and laptop there is not much space to move in the room what must be remembered is the head for the bathroom sharing separated between men and woman for the men bathroom at night it is still clean there is no trash at all but when the next day garbage started to appear and wa left alone i think this is a matter of individual responsibility the water is clean can be hot and cold there are no complaint at all about the water in the bathroom there are hanger and a flat place to put thing there is indeed no special smoking area in this hotel but on the 2nd floor near the bathroom there is an open area on the 3rd floor there is a pantry and prayer room clean but the trash can is small so there is a lot of garbage piled up there even though it is a place to eat plate spoon cup are provided complete with washing soap but it could be better if hand soap wa provided there is a microwave and water heater too there is no parking so those who bring vehicle especially car must dare to park on the side of the main road since i dont use a vehicle so i dont know how much the parking rate is overall good an economical choice for resting cold air conditioning and fast internet connection

Safira Pratiwi,5.0,2024-06-12 00:00:00,6,6763,overall oke seperti bobopod lainnya. minusnya cuma pod nya terletak di lantai 2-3 jadi harus naik tangga berkali² tidak tersedia lift. mushola hanya terletak di lantai 1/lobby.,overall okay like other bobopods the only downside is that the pod is located on the 2nd3rd floor so you have to climb the stair many time there is no elevator the prayer room is only located on the 1st floorlobby
