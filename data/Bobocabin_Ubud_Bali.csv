Stella Berdan,2,"First of all, on the positive side: the staff were very friendly and the place is really nice. You are surrounded by nature, which you can always enjoy through the large window in the cabin.
It was clear to us from the outset that you have to expect insects in nature - but we had a trail of ants running through the entire cabin, which was still okay for us. However, we woke up in the middle of the night to noises. When we turned on the light there was a rat next to the air conditioner. This is an absolute no-go. We then asked for another room via chat and luckily we moved at 3am. The new cabin was largely insect-free, but very unclean with hair and garbage.

Conclusion: We wouldn't come here again. For the price you can get much better accommodation.",5 days

Ween,5,"Our stay was fantastic as the scenery was beautiful, the room was clean and minimal facilities were provided- breakfast,toothbrush, shower gels, shampoo and bottled water. You also need to download the app to be able to pay and access the room. The only downside was being a distance away from town and upon asking for scooter rentals, only one was willing to accomodate(refer to my other review). You might need to search and ask a few rentals around the area. Access to transport via scooter or private cars enable us to access waterfalls(ulu petanu¬† & manuaba) nearby as well as the ubud town which is around 15-20minutes away. The staffs of the cabin were very helpful and friendly too. Just approach them if you need their help. Thank you bobocabin ubud!",2 weeks

Haulaam Leung,2,"We stayed there for two nights, the room had hairs and dust around, and dead insect bodies were on the wall. There was even an uncleaned dish in the outdoor ac unit. My legs are full of bites ( not sure is bed bugs or mosquitoes). The cabin door has a gap even though it is closed but the staff said it is normal. Only 2 sockets out of 4 in the room could be used.It is a waste of the concept if the place is not maintained properly.

However, the whole concept of the cabin is very cool with comfortable atmosphere, wake up with greeneries and the singing of nature!! The sound of nature could be heard in the cabin, which for us is like a meditation, we fell asleep fast and slept really well except for the itching part.
AC and hot water is good as well.

Staff are very friendly and responsive, we reflected on the cleanliness issues after we checked in, and they immediately attended to it, however, it was still not cleaned :(
Other than that, they respond to everything really fast, which makes our experience better.

It is a good place for just a cool experience if you don't mind insects and if you are not too detail-oriented.",3 weeks

Camille Bergeron,4,"Very cute and technologic place, but far from attractions and downtown. You need a scooter/bike or you need a Grab/gojek/taxi. At night, most drivers DON'T want to bring people around bobocabin since the road is dangerous and dark. In the morning, it's fine!

The bed was ok but only 1 small bed cover, no other bedsheets so we had to fight for it all night üòÖ.. also, I hope you don't mind the ants and insects, you're in the middle of the jungle so there will be insects in the room, especially in the bathroom. Food was not amazing, it came from the small restaurant in front. Service was great though!

A. S.,4,"Positive
- Located in very beautiful place. From our cabin window we could see the great landscape with the rice field.
- Very friendly and helpful staffs, always quick response 24 h.
- Interesting concept of design combining with the nature
- Operated everything through application (contact the staffs, order the food, ask for help etc) and smart function
- Privacy, the cabin we got located in middle of the nature far from other cabins
- very good price

Negative
- the location is far from Ubud even though it called Bobocabin Ubud
- Because everything in the cabin operated digitally through smart controller one night the system got an error so the light in the room turned on randomly and can‚Äôt be turned off. The staff had to come in the middle of thr night to fix  the system
- Have to download and application for staying here. There is no key. The Qr code for opening the door must be recieved through the application only.
- No cash, Qr code payment or card only
- Only one pillow
-not so delicious food

But we still appreciated and totally recommend this hotel.",4 months

Nights were filled with the ambient chatter of frogs and crickets, a real treat for someone craving the pure sounds of nature. Bear in mind, the spot's pretty tucked away, so you'll need a motorcycle to get around. My advice? Check-in during the afternoon and spend your day soaking up all that Ubud has to offer.",5 months

Kekurangannya si:
1. jauh banget dari parkiran ke tempat stay nya, kalo ada semacam eskalator enak tu wkwk.
2. Terus tolong juga kamarnya dicek takut ada serangga, karena tempatnya di alam banget, kemarin sempet nemu serangga kecil kaya kalajengking gitu buntutnya, ngeri si.
3. Tolong air minum nya ditambahin juga, atau kasih galon dimana gitu, udah jalan jauh ternyata air minumnya dikit cuman 2 botol (330ml per botol) pula.
4. Tangganya banyak, tidak bumil friendly :)
5. Sarapannya rasanya kurang, kemarin casenya nasgor

Saran untuk resepsionisnya, tolong di reminder tamunya untuk memastikan tidak ada barang yang ketinggalan untuk di bawa ke kamar gitu, karena takutnya kalo kamar nya diujung kan males banget ya balik ke parkiran lagi. Case saya gitu kemarin terpaksa balik lagi karena ada yang ketinggalan :)",8 months

The breakfast is something I did not like. They do not have much vegetarian options, whatever they had wasn‚Äôt great and also the fried noodles had an ant in it(can happen that the breakfast was kept outside for us and it crawled into the plate) I‚Äôd say skip the breakfast.

Tp memang cocoknya udah bawa banyak makanan trus ga perlu keluar2 lg krn dari cabin ke resepsionis jalan kaki naik turun tangga lumayan (apalagi yang dapt cabin di bawah).

Sudah included sarapan bisa pilih beberapa menu dan diantar ke cabin (bisa request jam).

Ada beberapa titik kumpul buat yang ingin duduk2 bersama teman/keluarga (jika datang rombongan banyak).

The way to Bobocabin was a little bit scary, a small road and the road had some gaps in it. On a fully packed scooter it was still doable.

When we entered the area of Bobocabin, we needed to register. Everything is through the bobobox application.

Once we had done 3 big stairs we finally got to our destination. It was a real blast, sitting in the middle of sawas in a hot tub.

We stayed at the hot tub - it felt so relaxing and rejuvenating after a day of rainy weather. Spending time in the cabin was really pleasant- the closeness of nature yet the safety of a cabin allowed for a great experience of the Balinese rice fields with serenity and tranquil. The hightech equipment of the cabin with a smart panel and light design was a relief and a proof that technology can support an experience of nature and make it more enjoyable and safe.

The cabin has a relaxing ambience with amazing greeneries view, comfortable, bright and airy. You will woke up by the natural sound of birds, what a rare moment. The cabin had a ample of outdoor areas for having a bbq dinner or just having an afternoon tea. Also, the cabin had en extra digital facilities, starting from check-in process, open and lock the door, turn-on and turn-off the light, change the windows type, f&b order, host contact, all in one apps (this facilities is my favorite). So, before check-in, please make sure you have Bobobox apps.
All of the staff was incredible - they were there for anything I needed. Fantastic and excellent service from the staff, starting from booking step until checked-out.
The location in a not crowded Ubud areas, perfect view & calmness atmosphere will heal your stressed out.

Gerald,5,"Quite hidden in the sandwich of Ubud villas, my first Bobocabin experience was satisfying. The cabin is just a cute small box perfect for 1-2 person(s), complete with a huge glass window (that can be blurred!) and hot shower. The cabin is neatly singled out as we had our own path from the stairs. Walking up is a bit of a hike but the rice paddy view is more than enough reason to walk more often. Colorful lights both in and out as the forest turns fluorescent at night. Will definitely be back again!",a year
Gonzalo Fortes,5,"A really good experience! I would definitely repeat. My partner and I stayed one night with the jacuzzi option, which really makes a difference. The cabin has everything you need, you are surrounded by nature, a huge rice field and the sound of falling water. Everything is Ecofriendly which speaks very well of the entrepreneurship. Detail like a bamboo toothbrush for example. It has the option to deliver food and even light a bonfire outside your own cabin, all managed from an app. The staff was very friendly too. Without a doubt something different and away from the hustle and bustle and traffic of Ubud.",a year
