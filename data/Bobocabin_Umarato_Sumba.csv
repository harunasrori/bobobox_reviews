Florencia Vener,5,"One of the best places to stay in Sumba South. The cabins are beautiful, the views incredible and the cleaning is very good!
They have the possibility of using the restaurant (always with prior reservation) which is located above the cabins, which is part of some more luxurious villas and is the best! The food was very delicious and the service was excellent, Juan was always attentive to everything, he is the best! The owner of the cabins and villas was also attending and was very friendly and attentive, always available to help us and advise us on whatever we needed. We are looking forward to returning.

Not a minor detail, the beach that is 10 minutes from the hotel is beautiful!!

Thank you!!!",3 weeks
Nina Azadi,3,"We booked this place for seven nights but left after four.

Although this place offers great value for money, we found it too small. There was no space to store our clothes. The hot water in the shower didn‚Äôt last for two people, no matter how quickly we tried to shower, and because of the metal structure, the space heated up very quickly in the morning. Additionally, our terrace was on the side where the sun rises, so we couldn‚Äôt relax there in the morning while enjoying our breakfast.

Overall, this is a good place to stay if you're on a tight budget and just want to explore the island. The view is great, and it has all the essential amenities.

However, you have to download their app to access the room and communicate with the host. Their customer service is extremely slow. When I tried to get a refund for the remaining days, which they didn‚Äôt give me anyway, it took them weeks to get back to me.",4 weeks
Andhika Rahadian,5,"Walaupun ukuran cabin gak terlalu besar, tapi rasanya hangat. Lampu kamar bisa diganti warna lewat hp atau tablet yang ada di kamar, viewnya juga keren langsung mengarah ke pantai Rua. Sayang di sekitarnya gak ada tempat makan, jadi harus pesan di hotel dan harganya cukup mahal.",a month

Sophia S,4,"Very nice location with a great view, unfortunately the service wasn't good and the food wasn't worth the expensive price. We ordered a steampot and expected fresh fish, what came were frozen fish preparations wrapped in plastic with far too few vegetables, unfortunately very disappointing",4 months

The only negative note is the restaurant service which does not offer many options and there is no alternative around the structure.",5 months

Macy Amatsari,5,"I stayed here together with my friend and originally we booked 6 nights, but we extended it with 4 more nights because we really loved the place. Our experience was so special, we received a warm welcome on our first day where we met all the staff and the owner. They celebrated Christmas early and we could attend and experience the sweet bond that every staff member has which each other. Sumba was for us a really special experience and we can not wait to come back, and for us this location and stay made it very special. The staff was so friendly towards us and they helped and responded really quickly. I hope one day I can come back to sumba and definitely would stay here a second time!",6 months

Simon Ming,3,Its a great view and very special experiance with the technoligy but the Service is slow and not very good. Also the food and drinks are waaaay to expensive for what you get. Also it smells hard on bathroom and you have to cook by yourself (they bring you the stuff to balcony) otherwise the food in the restaurant would be even moore expensive.,8 months
Alex Friedlander,2,"Although the bed is quite comfortable, the bathroom stank from the day we arrived, the service has not been good, the food was quite bad, a lot of bugs entered the room and, in general, it has not been the best experience.",8 months
Victor Corominas,3,"Correct new place, very new but the rooms are very narrow and very hot from the sun. There are no common spaces for working or eating, nor a restaurant or swimming pool. Everything is done on the terrace. And everything goes with an app, which makes everything a little complicated and slow. Especially for check in and check out. The views are the best.",8 months

Timotius Wibowo,5,"This place opened earlier this year and it was quite a fun 2 nights stay for us. There are only 8 cabins here and two of them are slightly bigger with a sliding extra bed that can accommodate up to 4 people.

The stay was a good experience overall. As the place is on a hill overlooking Rua beach the highlight was definitely the view from the giant window in the cabin and the beautiful sunrise view. A negative is that the concrete stairs can get a bit slippery when wet and you're not wearing proper footwear.

The room was basic but comfortable and definitely techie. With smart window and built in Bluetooth speaker, even a trippy Led light controlled with from a touchscreen display. One downside was that the water heater for the shower was only 15litres so after 2 people the next one in line would have to wait quite a bit for the hot shower to be ready. No fridge in the room but the staff helped us to keep our stuff in the lobby fridge. Wifi internet connection was excellent, which was a big plus as Sumba generally have poor and spotty internet.

The rates did not include breakfast and we brought our own food. But we are told it is possible to order breakfast and other food from bobocabin and even the resort nextdoor (with reservation). The location is pretty much in the middle of nowhere and far from town.",11 months
